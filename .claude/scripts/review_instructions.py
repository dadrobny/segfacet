"""Summarise which instruction files actually reach a context, and why.

Reads the JSONL written by ``.claude/hooks/log_instructions_loaded.py`` and
answers the question ADAPTER-SPEC §7 makes a contract point: is each rule being
*delivered*, or has it quietly degraded to a pointer nobody follows?

Three things it reports, in order of what they cost to get wrong:

1. **Rules that never loaded.** A `paths:`-scoped rule whose globs stopped
   matching is silently inert — the file is still there, still correct, and
   reaches nobody. This is the failure the whole mechanism exists to avoid, so
   it is reported first and it is the only one that sets a non-zero exit under
   ``--strict`` — an empty or missing log included, since nothing loaded there
   either. ``--strict`` is for a log you know covers work the rule should
   have matched; over a log of sessions that touched nothing relevant, a silent
   rule is the correct outcome, not a fault.
2. **Load reason per file**, since `session_start` and `path_glob_match` mean
   very different things: the first is a cost paid in every context, the second
   is a cost paid only where the rule is relevant.
3. **Per-session totals**, which is how a rule that fires far more often than
   expected — an over-broad glob — shows up.

What it deliberately does **not** claim: a file absent from the log was not
necessarily unread. A `Read` is never logged as a load, so an agent that
opened a conventions section by hand leaves no trace here. This measures
delivery, not reading.

Nor does it see a **preloaded section skill** (`.claude/skills/aide-*/SKILL.md`
named in an agent's `skills:` frontmatter). A preload is not an instruction
file to the runtime, so it never appears in this log — and it needs no
measuring: it is unconditional per spawn, so its cost is an exact structural
sum, printed by `tests/test_structural_budget.py` in the framework repo. Only
files actually in `.claude/rules/` are ever reported silent here; a rule the
framework has retired is removed from that directory by `install.py --update`
and is not a fault.

``--strict`` stays a human-invoked check, never a CI gate. The log has no
notion of which sessions *should* have armed a rule: a consumer's own
``paths:``-scoped rule beside the framework's is legitimately silent over
sessions that read nothing it matches, and a gate that fails on that teaches
the reader to ignore it. Reach is asserted structurally instead, in the
framework repo's ``tests/test_structural_budget.py``.

``--rotate`` archives the current log into ``log.reviewed.jsonl`` beside it
(``--reviewed`` to put it elsewhere) and truncates the live one, the way
``review_permissions.py --rotate`` does. Beside the *reviewed* log, not the
default one: rotating a log from another checkout must not mix its records
into this project's archive. A
log that only grows makes "never loaded" progressively less meaningful — it
averages over sessions from before a glob was last changed — so a review ends
with a rotation, and the next one starts from the sessions since.

Everything below the ``main`` boundary is a pure function so it can be unit
tested (see ``.claude/tests/test_instructions_loaded.py`` in this repo's
source tree).
