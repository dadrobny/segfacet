"""Aggregate the permission-prompt log into a review of recurring bottlenecks.

Reads the JSONL written by ``.claude/hooks/log_permission_event.py`` plus the
project ``.claude/settings.json``, correlates each requested call with its
completion to infer grant vs deny, drops calls already covered by an ``allow``
rule, and ranks what is left so the safe, recurring prompts can be promoted into
the allow-list.

Everything below the ``main`` boundary is a pure function so it can be unit
tested (see ``tests/test_review_permissions_*.py``). Normalised rules and coverage
checks are deliberately *advisory* — the full command is always shown so a human
makes the final allow/ask/leave call. The real allow-list edit is made by the
``/aide-review-permissions`` command, gated by the existing permission policy and
landed via PR.
