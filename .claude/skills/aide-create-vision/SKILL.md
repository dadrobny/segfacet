# Create Vision

Create the project vision document — Step 1 of the AIDE loop. The vision is the
foundation every subsequent step (roadmap, progress, queues, items) derives from.

## User Input

$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

### Existing vision check

Before creating, check if `docs/aide/vision.md` already exists.
- If it exists, **warn the user** and show a brief summary of the existing vision.
- Ask for confirmation before overwriting.
- If the user wants to update rather than replace, incorporate their input as
  amendments to the existing document.

### Asking posture

Vision authoring is **interactive regardless of `loop.clarify`** — that setting
governs `spec-author` on queued items, nothing else (`.aide/conventions.md` §5).
This is the one step of the loop where a human is present by construction; its
whole purpose is to capture what only they know. Ask until the mandatory
sections are grounded in the human's answers — never fill **Guiding
principles**, **Out of scope**, or **Success criteria** from assumption. A
wrong assumption here has no Assumptions block to be audited in and propagates
into the roadmap and every queue derived from it.

### Creating the vision

Write `docs/aide/vision.md` from the template **`.aide/templates/vision.md`** —
it defines the required structure. The four sections it marks `MANDATORY` —
Guiding principles, Goals & objectives, Out of scope, Success criteria — are
never dropped; what each one is read for is `.aide/conventions.md`
§1 → vision.md.

Requirements:

1. **Be exhaustive** — cover the full project scope.
2. **Explain reasoning** — justify what is included and why.
3. **Document exclusions** — state what is out of scope and why.
4. **Be specific** — technology choices, constraints, and assumptions.
5. **Concise but specific** — short declarative sections, no filler; specificity
   goes into objectives and constraints, not narrative length.

### Output

Save to `docs/aide/vision.md`. Vision changes are framework-level: they land via
a reviewed PR, never a direct merge.
