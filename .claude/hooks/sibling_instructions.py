"""Claude Code hook: surface a sibling repo's instructions the first time a
session reaches into it.

Registered on ``PreToolUse`` for the tools that can touch a path
(Bash / Edit / Write / MultiEdit / NotebookEdit) in ``.claude/settings.json``.

The runtime loads instruction files for the **working directory's** repo. A
declared sibling repository gets nothing, even when the tool is configured to
work in it — "additional working directory" does not imply "instructions
loaded". This hook extends the semantics the runtime already applies to
*subdirectory* instruction files across a repo boundary: on the first tool call
that touches a path under a declared sibling, the session is pointed at that
repo's own instruction file once, and nothing is paid by a session that never
reaches across.

Contract:
- Reads the PreToolUse hook JSON on stdin (``session_id``, ``cwd``,
  ``tool_name``, ``tool_input`` …).
- When a touched path lands inside a declared sibling repo not yet surfaced in
  this session, writes ``hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`` to **stdout** as
  JSON and exits 0. That context is a **pointer** to the repo's instruction
  file, never its contents — see ``_render`` for why.
- Otherwise writes nothing and exits 0.

Design rules:
- **JSON or nothing.** A PreToolUse hook's plain stdout is written to the debug
  log and never shown to the model — only ``hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext``
  reaches it. Printing to stdout would look like it worked and deliver nothing.
- **Never block.** No ``permissionDecision`` is emitted and the exit status is
  always 0, so the ordinary permission flow is untouched. Exit 2 would *block*
  the tool call, which is the opposite of the intent.
- **Fail-open, like its companion hooks.** Any parse error, unreadable config or
  internal exception exits 0 in silence. The worst case is the status quo: the
  sibling's rules are not surfaced, exactly as before this hook existed.
- **Declaration-driven, no new configuration.** The repos come from
  ``[framework] local_path`` and ``[hygiene] extra_repos`` in the personal,
  gitignored ``.aide/local.toml`` — already the machine's answer to
  "which repos does this project legitimately span". The instruction filename
  comes from the adapter's own ``default-context.json``, so the hook names the
  file the runtime actually loads without hard-coding it twice.
