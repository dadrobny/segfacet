"""Claude Code hook: enforce AIDE command hygiene on Bash tool calls.

Registered on ``PreToolUse`` for ``Bash`` in ``.claude/settings.json``. It is
the *enforcement* layer for the command-hygiene contract documented once in
``.aide/conventions.md`` §3 — the doc explains **why**, this hook guarantees the
mechanical rules are **followed** regardless of whether a (sub-)agent read the
doc. Without it, a reshapeable command that misses the allow-list stalls an
unattended run on a permission prompt; with it, the offending shape is bounced
back to the agent with the fix, so the run self-corrects and stays unattended.

Contract (mirrors the companion logging hook):
- Reads the PreToolUse hook JSON on stdin (``tool_name``, ``tool_input`` …).
- On a **high-confidence** mechanical violation it writes a corrective message
  to **stderr** and exits **2** — a non-zero PreToolUse exit blocks the tool
  call and surfaces stderr to the agent, which then reshapes and retries.
- Otherwise it writes nothing and exits **0** (no opinion — defer to the
  allow-list / normal permission flow).

Design rules:
- **Fail-open.** Any parse error, unexpected payload shape, or internal
  exception exits 0 (allow). A guard bug must never wedge the loop; the worst
  case is falling back to the ordinary permission prompt.
- **Narrow and conservative.** Only the unambiguous, high-frequency offenders
  are flagged, and string literals and heredoc bodies are blanked first so
  operators *inside* a commit message — quoted, or piped via
  ``git commit -F - <<'EOF'`` — never trigger a false positive. Positive-
  form guidance (use the venv-relative path, the ``aide`` CLI form) is left to
  the agent prose in ``.aide/conventions.md`` §3 — a hook can reject a wrong
  shape but cannot supply the right one.

def _heredoc_body_spans(cmd):
    """Every heredoc body in *cmd*, as ``(start, end, interpolates)`` character
    spans over the raw command.

    A heredoc body is data on stdin, not commands — ``;``, ``&&``, ``2>&1`` in
    its prose are never shell syntax, so the body must be invisible to the
    operator lints exactly as a quoted string is (issue #88: the guard blocked
    the multi-paragraph commit messages the framework itself asks for, via
    ``git commit -F - <<'EOF'``). The one thing that IS live in a body is
    ``$(…)``/backtick substitution, and only under an unquoted delimiter
    (``<<EOF``) — a quoted one (``<<'EOF'``, ``<<"EOF"``, ``<<\\EOF``) keeps
    the body fully literal — hence the ``interpolates`` flag, which lets rule 4
    keep watching the bodies where substitution really runs.

    The body runs from the line after its opener to the terminator line (bare
    delimiter; ``<<-`` also strips leading tabs; a trailing ``\\r`` is
    tolerated so a CRLF command does not read as unterminated). Several
    openers on one line stack their bodies in order. An unterminated body
    extends to the end — which is what the shell does with it too.

    A candidate that is not actually a redirection is REJECTED, because a
    phantom opener's "body" runs to the end of the input and would blank —
    i.e. exempt from every rule — everything after it. Rejected: an opener
    inside an already-collected body (prose quoting a heredoc); one not in
    redirection position (must follow start-of-line, whitespace, ``|``,
    ``&``, ``;`` or ``(`` — so ``a<<b`` never fires, which forgoes bash's
    mid-word redirection — including the spaceless ``-<<'EOF'`` spelling of
    ``git commit -F -`` — and the ``3<<EOF`` fd form, in exchange for never
    misreading a shift or prose, the pre-existing posture for those); one
    under an unclosed ``((`` seen outside quotes, where ``<<`` shifts; and
    one inside quotes, where it is a string. A rejected candidate's body
    text stays visible to the lints, which is exactly the pre-#88 behaviour
    for that command. Known residual: `#` comments are not parsed, so a
    ``<<WORD`` in a trailing comment still passes the gauntlet and blanks
    the rest of the call.

    Quote and arithmetic state come from ONE forward scan shared by every
    candidate (``_advance``), never a per-candidate rescan from the start —
    the hook runs on every Bash call, and rescanning made it quadratic in
    the candidate count. The scan skips collected bodies (a body is data: an
    apostrophe or ``((`` in its prose opens nothing), and only a ``((`` seen
    outside quotes counts as arithmetic, so a quoted ``"(("`` — a grep
    pattern, say — suppresses no later heredoc.
