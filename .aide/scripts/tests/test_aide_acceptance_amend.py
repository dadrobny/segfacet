"""Tests for amending an acceptance attestation — conventions.md §1 → progress.md.

The recorded defect (issue #118, spine-failure-lab under engine 1.22.0): a
Stage 0 box was ticked with the evidence "run on this CPU-only machine" on a
workstation with four GPUs. ``accept`` reports an already-ticked box as
"unchanged", so there was no CLI path to the correction at all, and it landed
as a hand edit of ``progress.md`` in a PR review — the one edit every role is
otherwise forbidden from making.

The guard against over-use is structural rather than advisory, and these tests
are what pin it: ``amend`` can only **add**, so it cannot be used to make an
inconvenient attestation agree with a shipped stage, and ``reword`` — the one
verb that edits in place — refuses the moment anything has been claimed
against the wording it would change.
