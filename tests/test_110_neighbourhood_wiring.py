"""Tests for item 110 -- generalise the neighbourhood API, then wire it into
the realised record.

The pre-refactor ``compute_neighbourhood_features(centroids, offsets,
geometries, window_n, outlier_threshold)`` took three fixed typed arguments
and ``VertebralNeighbourhood`` had nine fixed stat fields. This module tests
the target, generalised API (chosen here since item 110 authorises the
test-writer to fix the exact shape):

``segfacet.features.neighbourhood``
    ``DEFAULT_FEATURES: Tuple[str, ...]``
        ``("spacing_mm", "offset_mm", "volume_mm3")`` -- the historical three.
    ``DEFAULT_SCORED: Tuple[str, ...]``
        ``("offset_mm", "volume_mm3")`` -- the historical scored pair
        (matching pre-refactor ``_deviation_score``; ``spacing_mm`` is
        deliberately excluded, see ``UNSCORED_RATIONALE``).
    ``UNSCORED_RATIONALE: Mapping[str, str]``
        Non-empty human-readable reason for every ``DEFAULT_FEATURES`` name
        not in ``DEFAULT_SCORED`` -- reconciles AC4's "reported but
        unscored" cases so the historical silent spacing mismatch cannot
        recur undocumented.
    ``VertebralNeighbourhood`` (frozen dataclass)
        ``label: int``, ``level_name: str``, ``window_labels: Tuple[int,
        ...]``, ``stats: Mapping[str, FeatureWindowStats]`` (one entry per
        name in the ``features`` mapping passed in, each carrying ``mean``/
        ``median``/``std`` over the *whole* window including the focal
        element, plus a leave-one-out ``z_score`` against the window's
        *other* members), ``deviation_score: float``, ``is_outlier: bool``.
    ``compute_neighbourhood_features(elements, features, *, scored=
    DEFAULT_SCORED, window_n=3, outlier_threshold=2.0) ->
    List[VertebralNeighbourhood]``
        ``elements`` is an ordered sequence of objects exposing ``.label``
        (int) and ``.level_name`` (str) -- ``LabelCentroid`` already has
        both, so it is reused verbatim as the element type, no new type is
        introduced. ``features`` is ``Mapping[str, Sequence[float]]``, each
        sequence the same length and order as ``elements``. ``scored`` names
        the subset of ``features`` keys whose leave-one-out z-scores are
        combined (``max``, per AC5) into ``deviation_score``.

Serialised shape (what ``feature_report.py``/``pipeline.py`` must produce,
pinned by AC8's tests below): ``stage3.per_label_neighbourhood`` -- a list,
sorted ascending by label (matching ``per_label_offsets``/
``per_label_orientations``), of dicts with keys ``label``, ``level_name``,
``window_labels``, ``stats`` (``{feature_name: {"mean":..., "median":...,
"std":..., "z_score":...}}``), ``deviation_score``, ``is_outlier``.

If the builder implements a different surface, this docstring is the
authoritative record of what was actually tested against -- reconcile there,
not here.

Covers Acceptance Criteria AC1-AC13 (AC9b included):

- AC1: ``compute_neighbourhood_features`` takes ``elements`` +
  ``features: Mapping[str, Sequence[float]]``, not three fixed typed args.
- AC2: called with one, three, and five named features, returns per-element
  stats for exactly those features, no code change.
- AC3: ``scored`` is a parameter -- selecting a different subset changes
  which anomaly drives ``deviation_score``.
- AC4: under the default selection, every ``DEFAULT_FEATURES`` name is
  either in ``DEFAULT_SCORED`` or has a non-empty ``UNSCORED_RATIONALE``
  entry.
- AC5: with the three historical features/scored pair, ``deviation_score``/
  ``is_outlier`` match literals pinned from the pre-refactor implementation
  (computed by running the CURRENT, not-yet-refactored code -- see the
  module-level comment above the pinned constants).
- AC6: leave-one-out -- the focal element's own value never enters its own
  z-score's neighbour mean/std.
- AC7: window_n=1 -> score 0.0; a near-zero neighbour std uses the
  documented ``_MIN_STD`` floor; an empty element sequence raises
  ``ValueError``.
- AC8: ``extract_feature_record`` produces ``stage3.per_label_neighbourhood``
  for a multi-label case, sorted by label.
- AC9: fewer than 2 labels -> the block is absent (no ``stage3`` key or no
  ``per_label_neighbourhood`` key), never raises -- matches every other
  Stage 3 sub-block's degrade-on-too-few-labels behaviour.
- AC9b: a realised multi-label report (``run_qc`` + ``serialize_report``,
  which embeds ``stage3.per_label_neighbourhood``) still validates against
  ``report_schema_v0.json``.
- AC10: every new leaf path appears in the realised-record union, in
  ``FEATURE_DOCS``, and exactly once in the regenerated committed catalogue;
  the drift check (item 104's logic, replicated inline over production
  helpers) is clean both directions.
- AC11: entries carry ``status == "unwired"`` in the regenerated catalogue,
  and every corpus case's verdict/findings are unchanged
  (``segfacet.synth.regression.verify_case`` still True for all).
- AC12: ``progress.md``'s Item 024 mentions no longer claim outliers are
  *flagged to a verdict*.
- AC13: regenerating the catalogue (in-memory) and the goldens (into a
  scratch directory) twice each is byte-identical.

Adversarial / edge-case scenarios included: all-identical feature values
(zero std); a NaN feature value; a scored name absent from ``features``;
duplicate names in ``scored``; a window wider than the element sequence.
