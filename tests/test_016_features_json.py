"""Tests for the features-block JSON serialisation & feature table (item 016).

Covers all eight Acceptance Criteria plus adversarial / edge-case inputs:

* AC1 — features block round-trips into a schema-validated report.
* AC2 — every feature family (geometry/components/centroid + relationships +
  overlaps) appears in the JSON.
* AC3 — anisotropic physical volumes / extents / centroid-mm round-trip exactly.
* AC4 — schema extension is backward-compatible (feature-free report still valid;
  schema_version stays "0.1").
* AC5 — deterministic output + committed golden snapshot, stable key ordering.
* AC6 — per-case human-readable feature table, no Python-internal leakage.
* AC7 — empty / single-label maps handled.
* AC8 — pure / immutable / import-clean.

The tests compute the *real* feature objects from the synthetic fixtures
(``compute_label_geometry``, ``compute_components``, ``compute_centroid``,
``detect_overlaps``, ``compute_spine_relationships``) and feed them through
``build_features_block`` → ``serialize_report`` — exercising the whole
consolidation path against actual data rather than mocks.

All tests are deterministic, CPU-only, and portable (no network, no GPU).
