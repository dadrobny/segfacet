"""Tests for item 040 — committed synthetic fixture corpus spanning the
catalogued failure modes + the clean-control positive control, and its
manifest.

Re-pinned for item 150's maintainer sign-off (2026-09-14), which re-keyed
the taxonomy, and again for its catalogue revision (2026-09-15): the
corpus's modes are now ids of ``segfacet.failure_modes.SPECIFICATION``
(overlap is 15, not 8), "partial
vertebra at the FOV border" became the ``fov_truncation`` *condition* (mode
0 plus a non-empty ``condition``, not a clean control), every manifest case
gained a ``condition`` key, and two cases joined the corpus --
``fuse_adjacent`` (mode 2) and ``remove_level_relabel`` (mode 6, expected to
fire nothing). The ``modeN_`` case-id prefixes are historical and no longer
track mode ids. Group E below covers the new and re-homed cases.

Covers Acceptance Criteria AC1-AC18:

- AC1-AC6 (Group A, manifest structure & completeness): the manifest loads,
  is versioned, and round-trips through json.dumps/json.loads; every mode
  (and condition) the specification gives this corpus is represented, the
  expected set derived from SPECIFICATION/CONDITIONS rather than a literal
  range; case ids are unique and filesystem-safe; every case carries the
  full schema with correct types; failure_mode_name matches the shared
  taxonomy -- FAILURE_MODE_NAMES for a mode case, the condition's
  short_name for a condition case; expected_verdict is a valid Severity
  label.
- AC7-AC9 (Group B, detection classification): detection is one of
  {"pipeline", "reconstructed_record"}; the overlap case (mode 15) is
  classified reconstructed_record with the matching reconstruction technique
  (the relabel-swap case moved to pipeline in item 132, 2026-08-31, and the
  displace case in item 120), the rest are pipeline with no
  reconstruction; the
  reconstructed-record fixture genuinely hides its mode from plain run_qc.
- AC10-AC12 (Group C, fixtures load via the Stage 0 loader): every
  referenced fixture file exists; every case loads via load_case with a
  non-empty label inventory and matching scan/seg shapes; the clean_control
  fixture's inventory matches build_clean_spine()'s voxel counts exactly.
- AC13-AC18 (Group D, positive control & reproducibility): the clean_control
  case declares the queue-mandated pass verdict; the committed clean_control
  fixture actually passes the real pipeline (no findings, Severity.PASS);
  write_corpus(tmp) reproduces every fixture's loaded content; two
  write_corpus calls are byte-identical to each other and to the committed
  corpus; rebuilding each non-clean case's operator reproduces the
  manifest's expected_* fields verbatim (single source of truth); the
  one-command `main()` entry point regenerates a manifest with the same
  case-id set.

Adversarial / edge-case scenarios included:
- The case-level remove_level case (expected_labels == []) still loads
  and is schema-valid (mode 6, "vertebra not segmented", since item 150's
  2026-09-15 catalogue revision).
- Every seg_fixture path is distinct (no two cases silently share a seg).
- Every case shares exactly one scan_fixture path (the dedup contract).
- The shared base scan is byte-identical to a freshly written base
  build_clean_spine().scan_img.
- Re-running write_corpus over an existing directory reproduces identical
  bytes (idempotent regeneration).
- load_manifest on the committed file and on a fresh write_corpus output
  (a different directory) produce equal cases (relocatable, path-relative).
- A manifest case referencing a nonexistent fixture file is detected by the
  AC10-style existence check.
- Duplicate case ids are detected by the AC3-style uniqueness check.
- An unknown detection value is detected by the AC7-style domain check.
