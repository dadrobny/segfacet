"""Item 115 -- Stage 26 validation: the in-suite assertable subset.

Item 115 closes Stage 26 by replaying its use cases end-to-end (red-then-green
reverts, `segfacet run` replays, a fresh-clone suite run, ...). Per the item
spec's Testing Strategy, most of that is a *replay* obligation discharged and
recorded by the builder in `progress.md`'s Decisions log -- not something a
pytest module can assert. This module covers only the subset that *can* be
asserted in-suite:

- AC7:  the neighbourhood fork -- reachable + catalogued "unwired" + honest
        progress.md wording.
- AC8:  no byte-hash fence remains, searched by assertion *shape* (see
        `_classify_sha256_compares` below), not by the `_PRE_[0-9]` name.
- AC9:  every queue-016 spec (107-116) declares a non-empty
        `## Authorised paths`, and the framework's `parse_authorised_paths`
        (`.aide/scripts/aide.py`) reads each without error. Retargeted by
        item 117 from a since-deleted project-local scope-check script's own
        copy of the parser.
- AC12: Stage 26's five acceptance boxes are each either ticked *and*
        followed by an evidence annotation, or unticked *and* followed by a
        reason (the tick-implies-evidence biconditional item 106 established).
        Expected to FAIL until the builder adds the annotations.
- AC13: the Docker Environment-Gated Capability Verification row's state was
        not flipped by item 113 (which only *reduced where* Docker runs).

AC1-AC6, AC10, AC11, AC14, AC15 are replays with no stable in-suite shape and
are intentionally not covered here -- they belong to this item's Decisions
log and the Validation section, not to a test module.

# =========================================================================== #
# AC8: no byte-hash fence remains -- searched by assertion SHAPE, not name.
# =========================================================================== #
#
# Discriminator (from the item spec): a *fence* is a SHA-256 digest compared
# (`==`) against a hardcoded string literal, standing in for a diff-time claim
# ("this committed file's bytes are still X") frozen as a permanent runtime
# invariant. A digest compared against a value *computed in this same run*
# (hash -> run code -> re-hash -> compare) is an intra-run
# determinism/no-mutation assertion, not a fence, and must survive untouched.
#
# The classifier below walks every `==` comparison in tests/*.py whose either
# side is, or resolves to, a value built from `hashlib.sha256(...)`, and
# determines the SHAPE of the *other* side by resolving name bindings (one
# hop through a Name assignment, a `for a, b in D.items():` unpack, or a call
# to a module-level helper function) rather than by matching any name
# spelling:
#
#   - "fence"     -- the other side resolves to a plain string `Constant`
#                     bound somewhere in this file (module- or function-scope)
#                     that was NOT itself built from `hashlib.sha256(...)`.
#   - "intra-run" -- the other side resolves to a value that WAS built from
#                     `hashlib.sha256(...)` in this same run (directly, via a
#                     dict/comprehension, or via a helper function call).
#   - "external"  -- the other side is something else entirely (e.g. a
#                     dict/JSON-fixture lookup) -- nothing hardcoded in *this
#                     file's source*, so not a fence, but not a same-run
#                     recompute either.
#
# A comment mentioning a retired `_PRE_NNN_*` name is invisible to this
# scanner (comments never become AST nodes), which is the intended behaviour:
# a name appearing only in prose is not a runtime assertion of any shape, so
# reintroducing one in a comment is not a fence and must not be flagged.
