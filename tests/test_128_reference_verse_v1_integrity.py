"""Integrity pin for ``src/segfacet/reference/reference_verse_v1.json`` --
relocated here by item 128 (Stage 29, D3) from ``tests/test_098_stray_
components.py``, where it sat under an item-098 name despite protecting
something item 098 has nothing to do with.

``reference_verse_v1.json`` is a **released production artifact**: the
VerSe-derived reference-distribution artifact built from mounted VerSe19
ground truth ([`docs/aide/golden-decision-table.md`](../docs/aide/golden-
decision-table.md) Section 2, disposition ``keep``). It is
**not regenerable in CI** -- nothing in the test suite can rebuild it from
the real cohort -- so the sha256 pin below is the only thing standing between
it and silent corruption. Item 123 rebuilt the artifact from the real VerSe19
cohort under the item-120 held-out estimator and moved the digest; the literal below pins
that item-123-rebuilt state, and only whoever reruns the rebuild against the
real cohort may move it again.
