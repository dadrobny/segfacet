"""Tests for item 134 -- move the decision table's measured evidence counts
into a generated companion artifact (Stage 29, G7).

The nine Section-1 rows whose fixture path ends `/<case_id>.json` for the
nine corpus case ids used to carry a *live measurement* (`26/94 leaf paths
unwired`) inside `docs/aide/golden-decision-table.md`, a human-signed
document -- so every feature-adding item had to edit signed text just to
keep a number current (five such amendments before this item). This item
moves the measurement into a new generator, `segfacet.golden_evidence`, and
its committed companion, `docs/aide/golden_evidence.generated.json`, leaving
a digit-free pointer behind in the signed row.

Until the builder lands `src/segfacet/golden_evidence.py` and the committed
companion, every test here that imports the generator or reads the
companion is expected to fail (missing module / missing file), and AC6/AC7
are expected to fail until the builder also adds the `.gitattributes` pin
and confirms `aide check` stays clean -- not this module's bug. Imports of
the not-yet-built generator are deferred into function bodies so collection
still succeeds.

Covers Acceptance Criteria AC1-AC18 (AC8 and AC12 are asserted through the
reconciled `test_105_golden_decision_table.py` /
`test_126_golden_retirement.py` functions listed in this item's spec, not
duplicated here):

- AC1/AC2: the generator exports `build_evidence`/`render_json`/`main`, and
  `build_evidence()`'s `cases` key set equals the manifest's case ids with
  exactly the two mandated integer keys per entry.
- AC3: two fresh `main()` runs into distinct `tmp_path` destinations are
  byte-identical.
- AC4: the committed companion parses to the same payload `build_evidence()`
  returns.
- AC5: the committed companion's bytes carry no `\\r` and end with exactly
  one `\\n`.
- AC6: `.gitattributes` effectively (via `git check-attr`) pins the
  companion to `eol=lf`.
- AC7: `aide check` (called in-process via `run_checks`, never a
  `aide.py`-naming subprocess -- that shape is itself flagged by engine
  1.21.0's `cli_subprocess_test_warnings` lint) names neither new path.
- AC9: the nine golden-case Section-1 rows' evidence cells are all
  byte-identical, name the companion, and carry no digit.
- AC10: the three judgement columns of all eleven retired Section-1 rows are
  byte-unchanged since this branch's merge base.
- AC13: the amendment paragraph appears exactly once, the five mandated
  headings stay in order, the execution log still follows Divergences, and
  no line reads as a sign-off field.
- AC14: `test_105`'s `_SECTION2_EXPECTED_FIXTURES` is unchanged (seven
  members) and Section 2's rows still equal it exactly.
- AC15: a stale (off-by-one) companion payload fails the drift comparison
  naming the case id and both numbers, and the signed document is
  byte-unchanged before and after.
- AC16: `committed_artifact_guard.iter_violations()` is empty over `tests/`,
  its `GROUNDS` (six members as of item 149, 2026-09-04) is otherwise
  unchanged, and its `ALLOWLIST` gains no entry for the companion.
- AC17: no numeric leaf in the companion is a `float`, and its text carries
  no date, drive-letter prefix, absolute path or this machine's hostname.
- AC18: `test_105`'s post-retirement inventory count (20) still holds.

Adversarial / edge cases beyond AC15: `build_evidence()` called twice in one
session is idempotent; `main()` creates a missing parent directory; a
companion missing a case id fails naming the id (not `KeyError`); a
companion with an extra case key fails shape; a companion whose counts are
strings fails on type, not value; a mutated payload with a missing trailing
newline or CRLF bytes would fail AC5's check; a pointer cell that merely
*mentions* the companion while still carrying a digit is still rejected.

#: The tests/ non-.py fixture inventory as item 126 reconciled it
#: (2026-08-30). AC18's subject is that *this* item adds nothing to it -- the
#: evidence companion lives under docs/, not tests/ -- so the count is
#: expressed as that baseline plus the fixtures later items are known to have
#: added, never as a bare re-measured number.
_ITEM_126_INVENTORY_COUNT = 20

#: Added by item 150 (2026-09-14): corpus segmentations for the signed-off
#: catalogue's modes 2 and 4. Added by item 166 (2026-09-20): mode 3's split
#: fixture. Added by item 174 (2026-09-23): mode 3's split_own_label
#: fixture. Named rather than counted, so a fixture added
#: for any *other* reason still fails this test.
