"""Tests for item 032 — overlap rule (overlap).

Covers all 15 Acceptance Criteria plus adversarial and edge-case inputs:

- AC1:  OverlapRule registers under rule_id == "overlap"; discoverable.
- AC2:  No finding for a record whose overlaps list is empty.
- AC3:  A finding fires for two deliberately intersecting labels.
- AC4:  The offending pair is attributed by both integer labels.
- AC5:  The overlap magnitude appears in the reason.
- AC6:  Both offending labels are named in the reason.
- AC7:  Multiple overlapping pairs each yield one finding, in ascending
        (label_a, label_b) order.
- AC8:  min_overlap_voxels suppresses sub-threshold pairs and is
        config-driven.
- AC9:  The default threshold flags any present overlap.
- AC10: Default severity is FLAG, and severity is config-driven.
- AC11: An unrecognised severity string raises ValueError.
- AC12: The rule is deterministic.
- AC13: The rule tolerates degenerate / malformed records.
- AC14: The rule reads only the overlaps block (spacing-agnostic).
- AC15: The rule does not mutate the input record.

Adversarial / edge-case scenarios included:
- overlaps absent / None / empty-list / non-list ({}) placeholder.
- An overlaps entry missing overlap_voxels (treated as 0, suppressed).
- An overlaps entry missing a label field (contributes no finding).
- min_overlap_voxels threshold boundary is inclusive (>=).
- Determinism across two run_rules calls, including ascending order.
- Mutation guard via deep-copy equality of the record and its entries.
