"""Tests for item 137 -- disposition the four §6-mode-less rules (``bounds``,
``reference_delta`` -> analytic modes 1 and 2; ``intensity``,
``intensity_reference_delta`` -> mode-less, with the catalogue-gap finding
captured) and the new ``"rule_mode_less"`` ``mode_evidence`` tag that closes
Stage 19's G8 "statused but mode-unmapped" bucket honestly.

Post-merge correction (2026-09-02, commit b1c593c): AC2/AC3 below and their
tests originally pinned ``reference_delta`` at ``modes == (2,)`` on an
evidence sentence that falsely claimed the committed reference artifact
carries only ``physical_volume_mm3``. Measured directly, it carries 21
per-label features, and ``compute_reference_delta`` scores every one it
tracks -- including ``spline_offset_mm``, mode 1's own anchor feature
(``feature_docs.MODE_ANCHOR_PATHS[1]``). The rule now declares
``modes=(1, 2)``; the tests below assert that corrected shape, and a new
adversarial test ties the declaration to the tracked-feature vocabulary
itself so a re-narrowing to ``(2,)`` fails here even with nothing else
changed.

Covers Acceptance Criteria AC1-AC18:

- AC1:  every one of the ten registered rules carries a declaration with
        ``pending_reason == ""`` -- nothing ships pending.
- AC2:  ``bounds`` declares an exact analytic mode tuple -- ``(2,)`` at item
        137, ``(1, 2, 3)`` after the item-150 sign-off re-assigned the ids
        and widened the declaration.
- AC3:  ``reference_delta`` likewise -- ``(1, 2)`` at item 137 (corrected
        2026-09-02, commit b1c593c, from a false-premised ``(2,)``; see the
        module note above), ``(1, 2, 3, 5)`` after the sign-off.
- AC4:  both analytic declarations are analytic (``"analytic" in evidence``,
        ``"corpus" not in evidence``) and name the mechanism (>= 40 chars).
- AC5:  ``intensity`` / ``intensity_reference_delta`` are dispositioned, not
        pending -- mode-less at item 137, declaring mode 9 from item 146 and
        mode 10 after the item-150 re-assignment of ids.
- AC6:  both mode-less reasons are substantive (>= 120 chars, contain "§6").
- AC7:  ``intensity``'s reason cites the corpus manifest path.
- AC8:  the cited manifest evidence actually holds (no ``failure_mode`` key,
        exactly the four named cases).
- AC9:  declarations and the corpus-derived map still agree
        (``rule_declaration_conflicts() == ()``).
- AC10: ``mode_evidence`` carries ``"rule_mode_less"`` iff a consuming rule
        declares a non-empty ``mode_less_reason``.
- AC11: ``mode_evidence`` is a subsequence of the canonical four-tag order
        (or exactly ``("rule_unmapped",)``).
- AC12: nothing on this tree still reports ``rule_unmapped``.
- AC13: every entry consumed by ``bounds``/``reference_delta`` carries mode 2
        in ``failure_modes``.
- AC14: every intensity-only, non-anchor entry is honest about what it
        evidences -- ``(10,)``/``("rule_declaration",)`` where the rule reads
        it as a signal, ``()``/``("rule_bookkeeping",)`` where it does not.
- AC15: both committed catalogue artifacts regenerate byte-identically,
        ``schema_version`` still ``"1.1"`` (``"1.2"`` since item 148,
        2026-09-04).
- AC16: the catalogue-gap finding is captured durably in the insight inbox
        (or one of its archives).
- AC17: vision.md §6 stays at exactly eight numbered titles (provenance
        since the item-150 sign-off, not ids), and ``MODE_ANCHOR_PATHS``
        invents no mode id of its own -- its keys are signed-off mode ids
        ({1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}), with the ``fov_truncation`` condition's anchor
        held separately in ``CONDITION_ANCHOR_PATHS``.
- AC18: the disposition is metadata only -- replacing any of the four
        declarations leaves ``run_rules`` unchanged.

Adversarial / edge-case scenarios included: ``rule_unmapped`` narrowed but
still reachable (an undeclared stub rule, and a declaration monkeypatched
back to ``pending``); a future corpus case still binds an analytic
declaration (the escape-hatch guard); an analytic declaration claiming a
mode outside the specification is still rejected by
``catalogue.rule_declaration_conflicts()`` -- reconciled by item 147
(2026-09-04), which retires the reserved ``"corpus"`` evidence tag and the
declared -> corpus direction this scenario originally (also) exercised
through the same checker; the measured
artifact-movement counts from the item spec, including the corrected
mode-1-carrying-entry count; determinism of ``build_catalogue()`` and
``rule_declaration_conflicts()``; frozen-instance immutability; an entry
with no ``consuming_rules`` gains neither ``"rule_declaration"`` nor
``"rule_mode_less"``; an entry consumed by both an analytic declarer and a
mode-less declarer carries both tags in canonical order and keeps the
declarer's own declared modes in ``failure_modes``; the ``per_label``
container is honestly mode-less and carries its three rule-sourced tags in
canonical order; the insights search globs the archive files too; ``reference_delta``'s
declared modes are tied to its own tracked-feature vocabulary, not just
pinned by value, so a re-narrowing to ``(2,)`` is caught structurally.

    9 rather than shipping mode-less, so the per_label container entry can
    no longer carry 'rule_mode_less' -- but the same rules still reach the
    same underlying per-label paths, so the container still aggregates a
    'rule_declaration' tag from them, appended last (the aggregation order
    this container's construction has always used).

    Reconciled (item 148, 2026-09-04): the top-level ``per_label`` entry is a

    it, ``not-read`` for those three (item 148's Description, A2). No rule
    classifies it ``signal``, so it now honestly carries
    ``failure_modes == ()`` with both rule-sourced tags, restating the
