"""Static classifier + allowlist for byte-exact fresh-vs-committed comparisons
under ``tests/`` (item 127).

``segfacet.synth.golden.assert_matches_committed_artifact`` is the one path a
test should take to compare freshly-generated output against a committed
artifact (numeric-tolerance leaves, everything else exact -- item 078). This
module is the enforcing half: :func:`classify_module` walks a test module's
AST for a byte-exact (``==``/``!=``) comparison where exactly one operand
resolves to a **committed** path (a repo-relative file this repo ships, not
something the test itself wrote under ``tmp_path`` this run) and the other
operand does not resolve to that *same* committed path, then reports it as a
:class:`Violation` unless the committed path is covered by :data:`ALLOWLIST`.
:func:`violation_message` renders the failure, naming
``assert_matches_committed_artifact`` as the fix.

Standing rule: the emission-clamp requirement
----------------------------------------------
An artifact that reports a raw float measurement alongside its own
"meaningfully nonzero" threshold must clamp sub-threshold values to a fixed
sentinel at the serialisation boundary before it can be byte-compared --
quantisation alone (``float(f"{v:.6g}")``) cannot stabilise cancellation-scale
numerical residue, which is still noise at six significant digits (measured
2026-08-30, PR #56). ``segfacet.observed_range.emission_range`` is the shipped
example: a covered-but-not-informative population emits
``(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`` while ``PopulationRange`` keeps the raw measurement
for every caller that classifies on it. Five other grounds make byte
comparison legitimate -- see :data:`GROUNDS` -- and every :data:`ALLOWLIST`
entry names its ground and carries a one-line reason.

Standing rule: the no-float-leaf ground
-----------------------------------------
Item 149 adds a sixth ground, ``"no-float-leaf"``: an artifact whose payload
tree (walked to every leaf, JSON object values included) carries **zero**
``float`` instances is byte-safe to compare fresh-vs-committed
unconditionally -- there is no floating-point representation or platform
arithmetic residue for a byte comparison to be fragile against, only integers,
strings, booleans and ``null``. This ground is discharged by a dedicated test
that walks the payload and asserts the float count is zero, never by an
assertion in the reason string (the guard itself performs no float walk --
it is a static AST classifier, same as every other ground): see
``tests/test_149_conformance_report.py``'s
``test_ac21_traceability_matrix_has_no_float_leaf`` and
``test_ac21_failure_modes_specification_has_no_float_leaf``, which the
:data:`ALLOWLIST` entries below name directly.

Standing rule: the consumer-survey requirement
------------------------------------------------
A spec that changes a feature the reference artifact aggregates must survey
its consumers **mechanically** -- ``grep -l build_and_write_default tests/``
-- never by hand-listing. Item 123's recalibration is the precedent: the same
four-line fresh-vs-committed comparison existed in four unrelated modules, and
hand-listing found only three of them.

``src/segfacet/reference/reference_default.json`` is deliberately absent from
:data:`ALLOWLIST`: 454 of its 1133 float leaves (measured 2026-08-31) are
full-precision computed statistics, exactly the shape item 078 proved is not
byte-stable across NumPy versions, platform BLAS/SIMD and libm rounding. Every
comparison against it goes through ``assert_matches_committed_artifact``
instead (item 127's AC2/AC10 helper cases and AC16's synthetic violation both
exercise this exclusion directly).

Precise, not exhaustive
------------------------
:func:`classify_module` resolves an operand to a committed path only through:
a string literal passed to ``Path(...)``; a module-level constant built from a
chain of ``.resolve()``/``.parent`` starting at ``Path(__file__)`` (a
"``_REPO_ROOT``-style" root), optionally further joined with literal string
segments via ``/``; a local variable assigned from one of those in the same
function; and the recognised read shapes ``.read_bytes()``,
``.read_text(...)`` and ``hashlib.sha256(<path>.read_bytes()).hexdigest()`` --
including a local variable that was itself assigned from one of those read
shapes earlier in the same function (the "unchanged fence" idiom: read once,
do something, read again, compare to the stored value). Anything it cannot
resolve this way -- a loop variable, a function argument, a path built from
``tmp_path``, a value produced by an arbitrary function call, a value reached
through ``json.loads`` -- is skipped **in silence**. A reported
:class:`Violation` is therefore authoritative; a clean :func:`iter_violations`
run is not a proof of absence.
