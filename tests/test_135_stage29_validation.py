"""Tests for item 135 -- Stage 29 validation: the in-suite assertable subset.

Item 135 closes Stage 29 by replaying its acceptance end-to-end (the
retirement audit, a scratch-branch guard replay, mode 4 through the shipped
pipeline, the four-level held-out measurement, fails-before-the-fix replays
per defect, a fresh-clone suite, ...). Per the item spec's Testing Strategy,
most of that is a *replay* obligation discharged and recorded in this item's
Decisions log and ``progress.md`` -- not something a pytest module can
assert (the Assumptions section names the throwaway clone as the rig for
every replay that must not touch the working checkout: the fresh-clone
suite, the scratch-branch guard replay, the format-fixture deletion, and the
parent-commit checkouts). This module covers only the subset that *can* be
asserted in-suite, in the shape ``tests/test_125_stage28_validation.py``
established for Stage 28:

- AC1:  the eleven retired paths are absent; ``tests/golden/`` contains
        exactly ``report_format_contract.json``.
- AC2:  each of the four named replacements resolves to live module::function
        code that reads no path under ``tests/corpus/golden/``.
- AC3:  the format fixture's write-and-skip defect stays gone -- deleting it
        (via a monkeypatched ``GOLDEN_PATH``, ``test_111``'s pattern) makes
        its consumer fail naming the filename, not skip. This is the
        in-suite shadow of the scratch-branch deletion replay (Step 4),
        never a substitute for it.
- AC4:  the per-path ``git log --follow --name-status`` audit over
        ``69e5cf5..HEAD`` (queue-018's first commit to the branch tip),
        skip-guarded for a shallow clone or missing ``git`` (``test_116``'s
        idiom).
- AC5/AC6: ``committed_artifact_guard.classify_module`` on a source string
        containing the *same* comparison the scratch-branch replay (Step 5)
        adds yields a violation naming ``assert_matches_committed_artifact``
        -- the in-suite shadow of that replay, not a substitute for it.
- AC8/AC9: ``mode4_relabel_swap`` reads ``is_monotonic is False`` with the
        swapped pair named, through both ``extract_feature_record`` and a
        real ``segfacet run --no-reference`` CLI invocation.
- AC11: ``clean_control`` reads ``is_monotonic is True`` with empty
        ``non_monotonic_pairs`` and fires no findings, through both paths.
- AC14: **a pin on the observation, not on the wish** -- a 4-level curve with
        an interior level displaced 15 mm yields held-out offsets all below
        a stated degeneracy floor (item 129's exact measured array), while
        the same displacement at 5 and 6 levels separates -- so this pin
        does not read as "the estimator is broken everywhere". The
        docstring's floor/reason/gate language is pinned alongside it.
- AC15: the nested-label (coincident-centroid) map yields
        ``stage3_unavailable.reason == "coincident_centroids"`` naming both
        levels, through ``extract_feature_record`` and the CLI.
- AC16: both pin files carry the same ``tptbox`` version, >= 0.7.6, and the
        installed distribution's ``License`` metadata names neither AGPL nor
        Affero.
- AC24: Stage 29's three acceptance boxes are ticked-and-annotated or
        unticked-and-reasoned (the tick-implies-evidence biconditional item
        106 established), and box 3 is specifically unticked naming the
        four-level clause. **Expected to FAIL until the builder edits
        progress.md** (Implementation Step 13) -- this pin exists so that
        edit cannot silently regress once made, not so this item passes
        before it is made.
- AC12/AC13: Stage 28's mode-4 acceptance box (index 3 of 5) is ticked and
        annotated; its scoliotic-case box (index 4) stays unticked with a
        non-empty reason. Also expected to FAIL until the builder edits
        progress.md.
- AC25: the manifest's pipeline-detected mode count (excluding the mode-0
        clean control) is 7 of {1..7}, and the committed golden-snapshot
        inventory is 11 -> 0 with one surviving format fixture, agreeing
        dynamically with ``test_040``/``test_057``'s mode-set constants.
- AC27: ``python .aide/scripts/aide.py check``'s in-process ``run_checks``
        reports no error and no warning outside the two recorded baseline
        classes (missing ``## Assumptions``, a gate awaiting a decision).

AC26 and AC28 (this item's ``progress.md``/``insights.md`` diffs against the
queue-018 base) were retired from this module on 2026-09-16: the base branch
no longer exists, so both had become permanent skips, and a claim about one
item's diff belongs to the branch at merge time, not the suite
(``.aide/conventions/6-test-hygiene.md``).

AC7, AC17, AC18-AC23 are replays with no stable in-suite shape (the
scratch-branch deletion replay itself, the fails-before-the-fix parent-commit
checkouts, the fresh-clone suite, the environment table) and are
intentionally not covered here -- they belong to this item's Decisions log
and the Validation section, not to a test module.

Adversarial and edge cases covered:
- A Stage 29 or Stage 28 box ticked with no annotation, or unticked with no
  reason, fails the AC24/AC12 biconditional parser.
- A resurrected ``tests/corpus/golden/some_case.json`` fails AC1's glob check.
- ``_MIN_LEVELS_FOR_HELD_OUT`` moved back to 4 would fail AC14's separation
  companion assertions (checked via the live constant, not a hypothetical).
- A guard allowlist widened to cover ``reference_default.json`` would break
  AC5's in-suite shadow -- pinned by confirming the path stays excluded.
- Determinism: two ``extract_feature_record`` calls on ``mode4_relabel_swap``
  agree; two four-level held-out computations agree.
- Immutability: the four-level and nested-label maps are built in memory;
  no committed fixture, manifest, or format fixture is written to.
