"""Tests for item 112 -- ``compute_per_mode_metrics(overlap_result=...)``
short-circuit (``segfacet.eval.per_mode``), plus the ``eval.harness`` call
site that now supplies its already-computed ``OverlapResult`` instead of
letting ``compute_per_mode_metrics`` recompute it.

Covers Acceptance Criteria AC1-AC8:

- AC1: the ``overlap_result=None`` keyword exists, is keyword-only, and the
       default path (omitted, or explicit ``None``) is exactly today's
       behaviour.
- AC2: for the same inputs, the returned ``PerModeMetrics`` is field-by-field
       equal whether ``overlap_result`` is supplied or computed internally.
- AC3: with a result supplied, a spy on ``compute_overlap`` records zero
       calls from inside ``compute_per_mode_metrics``.
- AC4: the harness's ``evaluate_case``/``evaluate_cohort`` supply their own
       ``OverlapResult``; a spy confirms ``compute_overlap`` is called
       exactly once per candidate-present case (previously twice).
- AC5: harness per-case and cohort output is identical to the pre-item-112
       ("slow path": overlap computed once for the ``overlap`` field, then
       again inside ``compute_per_mode_metrics``) recomputation.
- AC6: a supplied ``OverlapResult`` that does not correspond to the given
       ``candidate``/``gt`` (different shape, or same shape but a disjoint
       label set) raises a clear error naming ``overlap_result`` rather than
       silently returning wrong numbers.
- AC7: the docstring names the checked invariants (shape, label set) and
       states that a same-shape-but-wrong result is otherwise trusted.
- AC8: existing call sites that never pass the keyword (``severity_ladder``,
       ``catalogue``) are untouched and keep producing the same output.

Adversarial / edge-case scenarios included:
- ``overlap_result=None`` passed explicitly (AC1).
- A matching ``OverlapResult`` for an empty (all-background) candidate/GT
  pair, extending AC2's equality check to the degenerate case.
- A caller-supplied ``OverlapResult`` computed with *different spacing* than
  the ``spacing=`` argument -- documented and tested as accepted (spacing is
  not one of the cheap invariants ``OverlapResult`` can carry, since it does
  not store spacing at all; only shape/label-set are checked per AC6/AC7).
- The same ``OverlapResult`` object reused across two calls: neither the
  object's fields nor its nested ``per_label`` tuple are mutated or replaced.
