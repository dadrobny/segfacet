"""Tests for item 114 -- documentation corrections: ``bounds.py`` comments
naming retired labels, and Stage 17's self-contradicting acceptance box.

Covers AC1-AC8. AC9 (whether ``aide check``'s rollup mechanically requires
every acceptance box ticked before a stage may be ``✅``) is left to the
builder's empirical evidence recorded in the item spec/Decisions log --
deliberately not pinned here, since the answer is not yet known at test-write
time and a test pinning the wrong answer would be worse than no test.

AC9's answer is now settled upstream rather than inferred: engine 1.5.0 took
acceptance boxes out of the derivation entirely -- the rollup skips checkbox
lines, no ``aide check`` rule gates a ``✅`` stage on them, and
``aide progress set`` leaves them as the author wrote them
(``.aide/conventions.md`` §1). A stage may be ``✅`` with an unticked box, and
ticking is the explicit ``aide progress accept``. So AC4 below is a plain
durable assertion; until 1.5.0 landed here it doubled as a deliberate tripwire
for the force-tick defect, since any ``progress set`` call for any item would
re-tick the box (``insights.md``, item 114/115 entries → aide-loop PR #32).

Two unrelated fixes, batched (see item spec):

(a) ``src/segfacet/heuristics/bounds.py`` comments still name labels retired
    by item 093 (``S``, ``Cocygis``) when the TPTBox convention became
    default. Behaviour (derived generically from ``CANONICAL_ORDER`` by name
    prefix) must not change -- AC3 pins that behaviour directly rather than
    relying on a comment-only diff.
(b) ``docs/aide/progress.md``'s Stage 17 fourth acceptance box reads
    ``- [x]`` while its own annotation opens by explaining it was *not*
    ticked. The box gets unticked; the annotation stays, reworded to explain
    rather than contradict; Stage 17 stays ``✅``.

Until the builder lands the fix, AC1/AC3(partially)/AC4/AC5 are *expected to
fail* -- that is the correct pre-implementation state.

#
# Matching rule (documented here so a future reader knows what is and is not
# caught): we flag (1) the literal word ``Cocygis`` anywhere, exact word
# boundary, plus (2) a bare ``S`` used as a *label name* -- which in this
# file only ever appears immediately adjacent to ``Cocygis`` in a
# label-list context: RST inline-code (` ``S`` `), a parenthesised list
# (``(S,``), a ``#``-comment list (``# S,``), or prose (``S and Cocygis``).
# We deliberately do NOT flag every bare occurrence of the character/word
# "S" -- that would false-positive on ordinary prose and identifiers
# (e.g. "AC13", "This", "severity"). Because every current bare-S-as-label
# site in this file sits directly beside "Cocygis", anchoring the S-pattern
# on that adjacency is sufficient and avoids the false-positive trap the
# item's adversarial note warns about.
#
# Adversarial: a retired name inside a docstring example must still be

# applied to the raw file text (docstrings included), so an example embedded
# in a docstring is caught, not exempted.
