## Stage 7 — Evaluation, Calibration & Metrics (G3, G7) — *Phase 1 complete*

**Goal.** Quantify performance and calibrate thresholds against VerSe GT,
TotalSegmentator output, and the synthetic corpus. Marks the MVP pipeline as
complete.

**Deliverables.**

- **Evaluation harness** comparing at three levels: QC verdict; DICE vs GT;
  feature-set match by vertebra label.
- Runs on: VerSe GT (positive control), TotalSegmentator outputs, synthetic
  failures.
- **Metrics**: FPR on GT, sensitivity per failure mode, DICE-vs-flag correlation.
- **Threshold calibration loop**; chosen thresholds + metrics recorded in the
  evaluation report / `progress.md`.

**Dependencies.** Stages 5, 6.

**Validation / acceptance.**

- GT passes at a high rate (low FPR) (**G3**).
- Injected failures are caught; flag rate / feature divergence correlates with
  DICE (**G7**).
- Calibrated thresholds + metrics recorded; evaluation is reproducible.
