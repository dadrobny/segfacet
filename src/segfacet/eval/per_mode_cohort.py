"""Cohort-level per-mode magnitude surface & run-vs-run comparator (item 101;
re-keyed item 153).

Items 099/100 built and validated a **per-case** magnitude surface: eight
named scalar metrics (:data:`segfacet.eval.per_mode.PER_MODE_METRIC_SPECS`),
each proven monotone in its own severity ladder (item 100). Nothing before
this module aggregated those metrics over a cohort, and nothing diffed two
cohorts. This module closes that gap with two entry points:

``summarise_run_per_mode``
    Folds a :class:`~segfacet.eval.harness.CohortEvaluation` whose records
    carry a populated ``per_mode`` field (:func:`segfacet.eval.harness.
    evaluate_cohort`'s opt-in ``per_mode=True`` hook) into one
    :class:`RunPerModeSummary` -- eight :class:`ModeAggregate`\\ s (mean,
    min, max, total, ``n_with_value``) plus, when a
    :class:`segfacet.eval.metrics.CohortMetrics` is supplied, item 054's
    detection-rate column read **verbatim** and never recomputed.
``compare_runs``
    Diffs two :class:`RunPerModeSummary`\\ s (the same cohort, two runs of a
    segmenter) into a :class:`RunComparison`: eight :class:`ModeDelta`\\ s
    plus an ``attributed_metric_name``/``attributed_mode`` -- the metric
    whose value moved the largest *normalised* amount.

The comparison arithmetic (item 109)
-------------------------------------
Per-mode metrics are not commensurable -- ``rogue_island_count`` is a count,
``mislabelled_volume_fraction`` is a fraction. For metric ``name``, with
``baseline`` taken from ``PER_MODE_METRIC_SPECS[name].baseline``::

    value_a           = mean over run A's cases whose value is not None
    value_b           = mean over run B's cases whose value is not None
    delta             = value_b - value_a

Item 109 replaced the original per-comparison ``scale = max(abs(value_a -
baseline), abs(value_b - baseline))``: that adaptive divisor saturated to
exactly ``+/-1.0`` whenever *either* run sat on its metric's baseline --
seven of the eight baselines are ``0.0`` -- so any comparison in which two or
more metrics returned to baseline tied at 1.0, and ``attributed_mode`` fell
through to the lowest tie-break instead of reflecting which metric moved
further. ``scale`` is now a **fixed property of the metric's own
classification**, declared once in the module-local ``MODE_SCALE_SPECS``
table and never recomputed from ``value_a``/``value_b``:

- **Bounded metrics** (a metric whose ``ModeScaleSpec.full_swing`` is not
  ``None`` -- today ``unanchored_foreground_fraction``,
  ``min_dominant_component_fraction``, ``mislabelled_volume_fraction``, the
  three ``*_fraction`` metrics) scale by their derivable **full swing**: the
  distance from ``baseline`` to the far end of the metric's own ``0..1``
  range, a constant with no free parameter and no supervision dependency.
- **Reviewed-threshold metrics** (``ModeScaleSpec.reference_excursion`` set)
  scale by that declared constant. No shipped spec sets one today (AC4) --
  the field exists as a mechanism for a future, explicitly human-reviewed
  declaration, never a default.
- **Everything else is raw**: ``scale`` and ``normalised_delta`` are both
  ``None``, and the raw ``delta`` remains available on the same
  :class:`ModeDelta`. Today that is every count metric
  (``rogue_island_count``, ``missing_level_count``,
  ``fov_clipped_label_count``, ``out_of_order_label_count``,
  ``overlapping_voxel_count``): ``rogue_island_count`` is a *maximum over
  per-label entries*, so a scan-level denominator would change the quantity
  rather than scale it; ``missing_level_count``'s only natural denominator --
  the levels the scan was expected to contain -- is ground-truth-derived and
  therefore barred from ever appearing in a divisor (no normalisation factor
  may introduce a supervision dependency, even for a metric whose own
  ``source`` is ``candidate_vs_gt``).

``normalised_delta = delta / scale`` when ``scale`` is known (``0.0`` exactly
when ``scale == 0.0``), else ``None``; it never divides by zero, ``nan`` or
``inf``. ``worsened`` is direction-aware and computed from ``delta`` alone,
independently of ``scale``: the metric moving *away* from ``baseline`` in the
metric's declared ``direction`` (``"increases"``/``"decreases"``, mirrored
from ``PER_MODE_METRIC_SPECS``) is worse --
``min_dominant_component_fraction`` decreases with severity, so a *negative*
delta there is a regression, the opposite sign of every other metric.

``attributed_mode``/``attributed_metric_name`` rank only :class:`ModeDelta`
entries carrying a non-``None``, non-zero ``normalised_delta`` --
unnormalisable metrics (raw ``delta`` but no ``scale``) are never silently
dropped from view: they are named in
:attr:`RunComparison.excluded_metric_names`. Among the ranked entries, the
attribution is the one with the greatest ``abs(normalised_delta)``; the
lowest-registry-order tie-break applies **only** on an exact equality of
that magnitude, never as a fallback for "nothing was comparable". When no
entry carries a normalised delta at all (or every one of them is exactly
``0.0``), the attribution is ``None`` and
:attr:`RunComparison.unattributable_reason` states why -- distinguishing "no
metric here is normalisable" from "every normalisable metric agreed nothing
moved".

Purity contract
-----------------
Both entry points open no file, read no clock, and never mutate their inputs
(a ``CohortEvaluation``, a ``CohortMetrics``, or a prior ``RunPerModeSummary``);
both are idempotent -- calling either twice on the same inputs returns equal
results.

Scope fence
-----------
This module does **not**:

- implement any new Dice/Jaccard/overlap arithmetic, and never calls
  :func:`segfacet.eval.overlap.compute_overlap` -- every magnitude comes from
  :func:`segfacet.eval.per_mode.compute_per_mode_metrics` (already attached
  to each case by the harness hook), and the aggregate Dice context is the
  mean of the per-case ``PerModeMetrics.mean_dice`` /
  ``.volume_weighted_dice`` fields item 099 already carries;
- read, import, or recompute anything from :mod:`segfacet.eval.metrics` --
  detection rates are read verbatim from a caller-supplied
  ``CohortMetrics.per_mode`` (item 054), never duplicated;
- register a rule, add a threshold, or change a verdict;
- read a manifest, drive the pipeline, or write a file -- this module is
  pure aggregation/comparison over already-computed records.
