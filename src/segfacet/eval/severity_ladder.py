"""Severity-ladder monotonicity & cross-mode specificity harness (item 100).

Item 099 proved *isolation on nine fixed corpus cases*: each of its eight
per-mode metrics (:mod:`segfacet.eval.per_mode`) attains its largest
deviation from baseline on its own §6 mode's single case. That is a
**one-point** result. This module builds the strictly stronger, **graded**
counterpart Stage 18's G2 acceptance actually asks for: for each of the
eight §6 failure modes, a **severity ladder** -- an ordered sequence of
rungs, rung 0 the untouched clean control and each later rung applying the
mode's perturbation operator at a strictly greater severity -- run through
item 099's :func:`~segfacet.eval.per_mode.compute_per_mode_metrics` at
*every* rung of *every* ladder (the full ladder x metric response surface,
not just the diagonal), then scored for:

* **monotonicity** -- is the designated metric non-decreasing/non-increasing
  (per its declared :class:`~segfacet.eval.per_mode.MetricSpec.direction`)
  and does it strictly change at every rung transition (a plateau, which a
  purely-directional check would pass, is treated as a failure);
* **cross-mode specificity** -- how large is the designated metric's
  response to *this* ladder's severity relative to every *foreign* metric's
  response to the *same* ladder.

Plus one **supplementary** ladder, outside the eight and outside the
cross-mode matrix: mode 2's *fused* half via cumulative ``fuse`` steps (see
below).

Why three modes have no continuous knob
----------------------------------------
``relabel_swap``, ``sequence_break`` and ``remove_level`` take only
target-label selectors (no continuous physical parameter). Two of the three
get a genuine ladder from the *count of affected labels*; the third cannot:

* **Mode 4** (``relabel_swap``) -- 3 rungs. Each disjoint adjacent swap
  mislabels two whole bodies (``n_affected_labels`` steps 0 -> 2 -> 4 on the
  five-level base), so ``mislabelled_volume_fraction`` steps
  0.0 -> 0.4 -> 0.8. Only two disjoint adjacent pairs exist among five
  labels, so the ladder is 3 rungs, not 4 -- recorded, not hidden.
* **Mode 5** (``remove_level``) -- 4 rungs. The three interior levels
  (21, 22, 23) are removed one at a time; ``missing_level_count`` steps
  0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3.
* **Mode 6** (``crop_at_border``) -- *its* metric (``fov_clipped_label_count``)
  is a **count of labels**, invariant to clip depth; ``crop_depth`` is
  therefore pinned at the corpus's ``5`` and the severity axis sweeps the
  *number of clipped labels* (20, then +21, then +22) instead.
* **Mode 7** (``sequence_break``) -- **degenerate**, 2 rungs, not merely
  inconvenient. Under the default (TPTBox, item 093) convention
  ``rank(v) == v - 1`` for every value 1-24, so no in-block relabel can
  produce a rank descent; the one transitional label that can (28 == T13,
  rank 19) always sorts last, contributing at most one descent.
  ``out_of_order_label_count`` is capped at ``1.0`` on this base -- a second
  break cannot add a second out-of-order label. Declared via
  :data:`DEGENERATE_LADDER_MODES`, never presented as graded.

The specificity bar
--------------------
For metric ``f`` on ladder ``L`` (rung 0 included)::

    span_f(L) = max_r v_f(r) - min_r v_f(r)

-- the *range* the ladder drives the metric through (its response to a
*change* in severity, not a deviation from baseline: a metric that jumps to
a fixed offset on a foreign ladder and then ignores that ladder's severity
*is* insensitive to that mode in the sense Stage 18 means). Then::

    response(m, f) = span_f(L_m) / span_f(L_f)     response(m, m) == 1.0
    margin(m)      = 1.0 / max_{f != m} response(m, f)   (inf when the max is 0)

A ladder is **strictly specific** when ``margin(m) > 1.0``. Pairs with
``response(m, f) >= COUPLING_THRESHOLD`` are **recorded couplings** --
measured, named, caused, frozen in :data:`KNOWN_CROSS_MODE_COUPLINGS` -- so a
real cross-mode leak is published rather than buried in a pass/fail bit.
:data:`RECORDED_MARGINS` freezes every mode's measured margin. Both tables
act as a *ratchet*: a future rule retune or feature change that flattens a
metric, or makes it more responsive to a foreign mode, must fail
(``measured_response <= recorded * 1.05``, ``measured_margin >= recorded *
0.95``) rather than quietly eroding the stage's claim.

Purity & determinism contract
------------------------------
Every function here is pure: no file I/O, no clock, no mutation of the base
image/array any rung is derived from. All randomness is banned by
construction -- every ladder step passes explicit target labels, so no
operator ever consults ``seeded_rng`` for a choice; :data:`LADDER_SEED` is
still threaded through every ``apply()`` call to honour the
``Perturbation`` signature. Every ``to_dict()`` returns a plain-JSON
structure that round-trips through ``json.dumps``/``json.loads`` unchanged.

Scope fence
-----------
This module does **not**:

* change any metric -- :mod:`segfacet.eval.per_mode` is untouched; the only
  route to a metric value is a call to
  :func:`~segfacet.eval.per_mode.compute_per_mode_metrics`;
* change any operator or the corpus -- :mod:`segfacet.synth` and
  ``tests/corpus/**`` are untouched; no new perturbation is registered; the
  missing ``fuse`` corpus case (item 099's insight) is not added here, it is
  measured in-memory via :data:`SUPPLEMENTARY_LADDERS` instead;
* change any rule, threshold, schema or CLI surface;
* aggregate over a real cohort or read a manifest (item 101's job);
* make a real-data claim -- every ladder here is synthetic.

#: Two measured cross-mode couplings. Mode 6 -> metric 1 was anticipated by
#: item 099 (see the module docstring and the item's Assumptions):
#: ``crop_at_border``, ``displace`` and ``force_overlap`` all translate a
#: body rigidly, so all three put candidate foreground over GT background --
#: and mode 1's own ladder is FOV-capped (~19.8 mm max ``displacement_mm`` on
#: this base) while mode 6's scales linearly with the number of cropped
#: labels, so it *exceeds* the strict bar (response > 1.0), exactly as
#: predicted. Mode 8 -> metric 1 was **not** anticipated by item 099 (whose
#: Assumptions named only ``{(6, 1)}``) and is recorded here per the item's
#: instruction to call out any additional measured coupling in the Decisions
#: log: ``force_overlap`` shifts the whole target body by ``gap +
#: overlap_depth`` voxels along the stacking axis, and the constant 15 mm
#: inter-body gap dominates that shift, so most of mode 8's
#: ``unanchored_foreground_fraction`` response is a rigid-translation
#: artefact largely independent of ``overlap_depth`` -- its span nearly
#: matches mode 1's own full swing (measured response 0.9629, margin only
#: ~1.039), even though mode 8's own designated metric
#: (``overlapping_voxel_count``) remains a clean, strictly specific isolator.
