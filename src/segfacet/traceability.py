"""Generated failure-mode conformance report (item 149; Stage 30 -- Failure-
Mode Specification: the §6 catalogue as an authored source).

Items 144-148 built ``segfacet.failure_modes.SPECIFICATION`` as the
**primary, authored record** of every §6 failure mode -- a schema, a
derivation for lifecycle status and evidence rung, and a per-corpus-case
measured firing set. Before item 149, this module (item 138) instead
cross-checked **five partial sources** that could agree or disagree with no
document able to adjudicate. That cross-check is retired: :func:`build_matrix`
now reads the specification as its **primary source** (:data:`primary_source`
in every rendered artifact, ``"src/segfacet/failure_modes.py"``), and reports,
per mode:

- the *derived* lifecycle ``status`` (:func:`segfacet.failure_modes.derive_status`)
  beside the *authored* ``authored_status`` (``ModeSpec.status``);
- one ``edge_rungs`` entry per ``IntendedRule`` the specification carries for
  that mode, verbatim and in order, plus the derived per-mode ``rung``
  (:func:`segfacet.failure_modes.derive_mode_rung`);
- two **separate, separately-labelled** path columns: ``anchor_paths`` (the
  Stage-18 metric anchor, unfiltered, from
  ``segfacet.feature_docs.MODE_ANCHOR_PATHS``) and ``read_paths`` (the sorted
  union, over the mode's declaring rules, of the leaf paths each rule
  classifies ``"signal"`` -- item 148's
  ``RuleModeDeclaration.consumed_paths`` / ``CatalogueEntry.mode_roles``).
  Never unioned into one field (item 138's ``feature_paths`` conflation is
  gone).

And, new in item 149, a **conformance direction**: per case in **both**
committed corpus manifests (``tests/corpus/manifest.json`` and
``tests/corpus/intensity/manifest.json``), the specification's *expected*
firing set beside the *measured* firing set
(:func:`segfacet.failure_modes.measured_firing`), scored for agreement. A
manifest case with no ``ModeSpec.corpus_cases`` entry covering it is a named
hole (``expected_source == "unspecified"``); the two ``failure_mode == 0``
clean controls are scored too, labelled ``"manifest-clean-control"`` since §6
defines no mode 0. This is the check none of queue-019's shape tests could
express: running the case and comparing the sets tests the specification's
*truth*, not merely its *shape*.

Two directions are unaffected by this item and stay exactly as item 138 left
them, over the same registered-rule/registry-declaration inputs:

- **mode -> rule** / **rule -> mode** -- each *scored*, not guaranteed:
  read the ``complete``/``holes`` fields under ``directions`` for the live
  answer.
- **feature -> rule** -- deliberately **not** complete; the qualifier beside
  the count says why (unchanged from item 138).

Every ``(mode, rule)`` edge carries an **attribution** -- ``"corpus"`` when at
least one of that mode's ``SPECIFICATION[mode].corpus_cases`` lists the rule
in its ``expected_firing``, ``"analytic"`` otherwise. This, too, is a
"primary source" move (item 149 Decision D2): before this item the column was
derived from :func:`segfacet.catalogue.scan_synth_rule_mode_map`, an AST scan
matching only geometric ``Expectation(...)`` literals, so mode 9's
``intensity`` edge (corpus-designated only in the intensity manifest, which
the scan never reads) rendered ``"analytic"`` beside a rung claiming three
committed intensity cases drive it end-to-end. The scan is still read, for
``corpus_designated_unregistered_rule_ids`` only.

An unclassified or dropped ``consumed_paths`` entry is folded in from
:func:`segfacet.catalogue.path_classification_conflicts` as
``classification_conflicts`` rather than re-derived, and contributes to the
matrix-level ``conformance.conformant`` flag alongside the per-case agreement
count.

Scope fence
-----------
This module *reports*. It decides no disposition, changes no rule,
threshold, extractor, verdict, report schema, or CLI behaviour, and
regenerates neither of item 103's catalogue artifacts. It builds **no**
per-rule or per-operator corpus-**exercise** columns -- item 139's
deliverable, re-specified against this output, stays Stage 20's. It adopts
no specificity ratchet (item 140) and does not touch
``eval/severity_ladder.py`` (item 141).

Determinism contract
---------------------
:func:`build_matrix` never mutates any input; two calls return equal,
immutable matrices (frozen dataclasses / tuples throughout), and it holds
**no cache** -- deliberately, so the adversarial monkeypatch tests that prove
the report is live cannot be defeated by a memoised result. Heavy imports
(NumPy/SciPy/NiBabel, via ``segfacet.catalogue``/``segfacet.heuristics``/
``segfacet.failure_modes``) are deferred into function bodies, per house
style, so ``import segfacet.traceability`` alone stays cheap and importing it
plus calling :func:`build_matrix` never mutates any importable module's
state (AC32).

Public API
----------
``build_matrix() -> TraceabilityMatrix``
    Assemble the full matrix. Takes no required argument.
``matrix_to_dict(matrix) -> dict``
    A deterministic, JSON-ready dict. ``json.dumps(..., indent=2,
    sort_keys=True, ensure_ascii=False)`` plus one trailing newline is the
    committed JSON's exact serialisation.
``render_markdown(matrix) -> str``
    A deterministic Markdown rendering of the same matrix.
``main(argv=None) -> int``
    ``python -m segfacet.traceability [--json PATH] [--md PATH]``; defaults
    to the two committed artifact paths under ``docs/aide/``.

# =========================================================================== #
# Retired here by item 147 (2026-09-04): ``RUNGS``, ``RUNG_LABELS``,
# ``ModeRung`` and ``MODE_RUNGS``.
#
# This module authored a mode's evidence rung and mechanism sentence as
# constants while there was nowhere better to put them. There is now:
# ``segfacet.failure_modes.SPECIFICATION`` carries a per-**edge**
# ``evidence_rung`` (item 145) that ``derive_mode_rung()`` folds into a
# per-mode rung, and an authored ``ModeSpec.mechanism`` (item 147). The rung
# vocabulary lives beside it as ``failure_modes.EVIDENCE_RUNGS``, and
# ``RUNG_LABELS`` moved there verbatim. ``build_matrix`` reads all of it
# live, so modes 9 and 10 -- which this module's authored dict never carried
# -- stop rendering an empty rung and an empty title.
#
# Item 149 re-points ``build_matrix`` itself at the specification as its
# primary source (the "conflated union" ``feature_paths`` field the earlier
# comment block described is gone too -- see ``read_paths``/``anchor_paths``
# below). Do not re-introduce a constant, a rung dict literal, or a module-
# level ``MODE_RUNGS``/``ModeRung``/``RUNGS``/``RUNG_LABELS`` binding here: a
# mode fact belongs in the specification.
