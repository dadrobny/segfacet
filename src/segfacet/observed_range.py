"""Observed-range column for the generated feature catalogue (item 124).

For every catalogue leaf path, computes an :class:`ObservedRange` carrying
two independent populations plus a derived verdict:

- **corpus** -- the numeric values realised across
  :func:`segfacet.catalogue.iter_driver_records`, the in-package synthetic
  driver set. It never accuses a feature of being dead: a flat corpus range
  is reported as ``"constant-synthetic"``, never ``"degenerate"`` (the
  corpus's nine fixtures share one base geometry, so a flat corpus range says
  as much about the fixture as about the feature).
- **reference** -- the aggregated ``min``/``max`` of the matching feature in
  the committed real-GT reference distribution
  (:func:`segfacet.reference.artifact.bundled_production_reference`, or an
  injected artifact). Only this population can produce the ``"degenerate"``
  verdict.

Why two populations, and what the magnitude floor is calibrated against, is
in the item spec's Description --
``docs/aide/items/124-observed-range-column-in-the-catalogue.md``.

**Coverage limitation.** Only the 21 feature names carried by the reference
distribution's vocabulary can ever resolve onto a leaf path and therefore
ever read ``"degenerate"``; the remaining numeric paths get their corpus
numbers reported and no verdict stronger than ``"constant-synthetic"``.

Scope fence
-----------
This module adds no extractor, no rule, no threshold. It never mutates the
``status`` field or ``feature_docs.STATUS_OVERRIDES``, and never recomputes
anything from the VerSe19 cohort -- the reference population is read from the
committed artifact only, so generation stays hermetic on a machine with no
dataset. Heavy imports (``segfacet.catalogue``, ``segfacet.reference.*``) are
deferred into function bodies so importing this module alone stays cheap and
no import cycle forms with ``catalogue.py``.

Public API
----------
``NEGLIGIBLE_MAGNITUDE``
    The unit-agnostic magnitude floor (``1e-3``) below which a population is
    not ``informative``.
``PopulationRange``, ``ObservedRange``
    Frozen dataclasses.
``iter_leaf_values(record) -> dict[str, list]``
    A value-collecting sibling of ``catalogue._walk_leaf_paths``.
``resolve_reference_features(leaf_paths) -> dict[str, str]``
    ``{reference_feature_name: leaf_path}``, three ordered resolution rules.
``build_observed_ranges(*, driver_records=None, reference=None) -> dict[str, ObservedRange]``
    The whole computation, one entry per realised/reference-resolved path.
``emission_range(pop) -> (minimum, maximum, span, magnitude)``
    The values a byte-compared artifact should emit for *pop* (see "Sub-floor
    noise is clamped to 0.0 at emission" below).

Sub-floor noise is clamped to 0.0 at emission
----------------------------------------------
A population whose magnitude sits below :data:`NEGLIGIBLE_MAGNITUDE` is, by
construction, ``informative == False`` -- but its raw ``minimum``/
``maximum``/``span``/``magnitude`` are still real floating-point measurements
(e.g. a corpus block on a `principal_axis`-family path measured
``magnitude=3.66317e-14``, ``minimum=-8.26248e-15``). Below the floor those
digits are numerical noise: cancellation-scale residue from NumPy/SciPy
linear algebra that legitimately differs by more than one ULP across NumPy
builds and even CPU microarchitectures, while remaining well within the
floor either way. Discovered 2026-08-30 when PR #56's CI matrix ran the
identical revision against numpy 1.26.4 twice and got two different
byte-exact results on those paths -- ``float(f"{v:.6g}")`` quantisation
(item 124's AC15) cannot stabilise a value that is noise rather than signal;
six significant digits of noise are still noise.

:func:`build_observed_ranges` therefore keeps reporting the raw measured
values on :class:`PopulationRange` (``minimum``/``maximum``/``span``/
``magnitude`` are never altered there, and neither is ``informative``,
``covered``, ``count``, or ``source``) -- callers that want the exact
measurement, or that classify on it, still see it. Only
:func:`emission_range`, called from :mod:`segfacet.catalogue`'s serialisers
(``catalogue_to_dict`` / ``render_markdown``) when building the byte-compared
JSON/Markdown artifacts, clamps a covered-but-not-informative population's
four numeric fields to ``0.0``; an uncovered population's fields stay
``None`` (nulls stay nulls -- AC4 is unaffected). Verdict classification
(:func:`_derive_verdict`, and therefore ``informative`` itself) is computed
from the raw, unclamped :class:`PopulationRange` *before* any call to
:func:`emission_range` ever happens -- clamping is applied only at emission,
never before deriving a verdict, so no verdict is affected by it.
