"""Generated feature & rule catalogue (item 103; Stage 19).

The single shared generator behind two committed artifacts
(``docs/aide/feature_catalogue.generated.json`` / ``.md``) and the HTML status
report's Feature Catalogue section (``scripts/aide_status_report.py``). It
replaces the hand-typed ``FEATURE_CATALOG`` literal that used to live in the
status-report script with a catalogue built from the *realised* record shape
plus **code-derived** rule/mode attribution, joined with authored prose from
:mod:`segfacet.feature_docs`.

Four derivation mechanisms, each carrying its own evidence tag
--------------------------------------------------------------
- **A. Dynamic access trace** (``observed``) — wrap a realised driver record in
  a non-invasive ``dict``-subclass proxy (:func:`trace_record_access`) that
  records every leaf path actually read, then run every registered rule
  (:func:`segfacet.heuristics.rule.iter_rules`) over the traced record.
- **B. Static AST scan of ``heuristics/*.py``** (``static``) — string
  constants used as a subscript key or as ``.get(...)``'s first positional
  argument in *each rule's own module file*, matched to catalogue paths by
  last path segment -- but **only when that last segment names exactly one**
  leaf path (item 110, AC11b). Catches branches the driver set never realises
  (e.g. ``overlaps[].overlap_voxels`` when the driver set happens not to
  populate it). A name shared by >1 leaf path's last segment (e.g. ``label``,
  ``level_name``, ``mean``, ``median``, ``std``) carries no positional
  information tying it to a specific block, so it contributes no evidence for
  *any* of its candidates rather than guessing "keep" for all of them
  (the pre-item-110 behaviour, tagged ``static-ambiguous``, produced exactly
  this false-positive shape whenever an unrelated block reused a generic key
  name).
- **C. Static AST scan of ``synth/*.py``** — ``rule_id -> failure mode(s)``, read
  off every ``Expectation(failure_mode=N, ..., expected_rule_ids=frozenset(
  {...}))`` call's literal keyword pairs. No hand-typed rule-id -> mode
  dictionary exists anywhere in this module's source (drift guard, AC13).
  Exposed publicly as :func:`scan_synth_rule_mode_map`. It matches only
  geometric ``Expectation(...)`` literals under ``src/segfacet/synth/*.py``
  and cannot see the intensity corpus, whose cases are ``_RecipeEntry(...)``
  literals (item 156, Seam 2) — see the function's own docstring for its two
  remaining consumers.
- **D. Non-rule consumers** (``observed`` / ``vocabulary``) — the same trace
  proxy run through ``eval.per_mode.compute_per_mode_metrics`` and
  ``human_report.render_feature_table``, plus the declared feature-name
  vocabularies (``reference.delta.MORPHOLOGY_FEATURES``,
  ``reference.ingest.INGESTED_FEATURES``, ``eval.feature_match.
  TRACKED_FEATURES``) matched by last path segment via
  :data:`segfacet.feature_docs.PATH_ALIASES`.

A third source of ``mode_evidence`` (item 136) sits alongside C: each
registered rule's own class-attribute ``RuleModeDeclaration``
(:mod:`segfacet.heuristics.rule`) states the failure mode(s) it targets (or that
it targets none, or that its disposition is pending). ``mode_evidence`` gains
the tag ``"rule_declaration"`` when at least one of an entry's
``consuming_rules`` carries a declaration with non-empty ``modes``. Because
declared modes may include an *analytic* attribution with no corpus
corroboration (item 137's ``bounds``/``reference_delta``, tagged
``"analytic"`` rather than ``"corpus"`` in the declaration's own
``evidence``), a declared mode is **not** guaranteed to already be a subset
of mechanism C's corpus-derived map — against *that* map,
:func:`rule_declaration_conflicts` only enforces the corpus → declaration
direction (a corpus case must be reflected in the declaration), never the
declaration → corpus-map reverse (item 147 retired that direction
permanently; a declaration's *analytic* attribution is legitimately absent
from the corpus). Disagreement between the declaration and the corpus-derived
map — in either enforced direction — is reported by
:func:`rule_declaration_conflicts`, never silently resolved here.
:func:`rule_declaration_conflicts` also enforces a *second*, unrelated
reverse direction (item 156, Seam 1): declaration → **specification** (not
the corpus-derived map) — every declared known mode must be mirrored by an
``IntendedRule`` edge in :data:`segfacet.failure_modes.SPECIFICATION`.

A fourth tag, ``"rule_mode_less"`` (item 137, ordered last — after
``"rule_declaration"``), marks an entry with at least one consuming rule
that has *declared itself mode-less* (a non-empty ``mode_less_reason``): a
source that spoke and said "no mode", categorically different from
``"rule_unmapped"`` ("nobody has said"). After item 137, ``"rule_unmapped"``
means exactly that latter case — a consuming rule with no corpus-derived
modes, no declared modes, and no mode-less declaration either — and is
reachable only when a shipped rule carries no ``RuleModeDeclaration`` at all
or an undischarged ``pending_reason`` (neither ships on this tree; both are
exercised adversarially by the test suite).

Per-path classification (item 148)
-----------------------------------
Both rule-sourced mode terms are **gated per path**. Each declaration also
carries ``consumed_paths`` — a ``ConsumedPath(path, role, reason)`` for every
leaf path this module attributes to that rule, with ``role`` from the closed
vocabulary ``("signal", "bookkeeping", "not-read", "condition-signal")`` (see
:data:`segfacet.heuristics.rule.PATH_ROLES`). A rule contributes its
corpus-derived (C) and declared (item 136) modes to a path **only** where
that ``(rule, path)`` pair is ``"signal"``: before item 148 every leaf path a
declaring rule consumed inherited that rule's *whole* mode tuple, so pure
bookkeeping paths (label ids, level names, containers iterated, availability
gates, band values interpolated into a message) were painted with modes they
cannot evidence. A rule whose ``consumed_paths`` is empty contributes
**nothing** — never a fall-back to the item-136 behaviour, which would be a
silent default; :func:`path_classification_conflicts` reports it, along with
an unclassified consumed path, a classified path the rule does not consume,
and a ``"not-read"`` claim on a pair mechanism A observed being read. The
classification is *declared, never inferred*: no heuristic over path names,
no default. The path-keyed item-099 anchor term is untouched — it is already
per-path.

The classification is **rendered, not silently applied**:
``CatalogueEntry.mode_roles`` carries the entry's ``(rule_id, role)`` pairs
into both artifacts (the JSON's ``"mode_roles"`` key, the Markdown's
``Mode role(s)`` column), and ``mode_evidence`` gains
``"rule_bookkeeping"`` / ``"rule_not_read"``, so a reader can tell "a source
spoke and said this path cannot evidence a mode" from ``"rule_unmapped"``
("nobody has said") and from ``()`` ("no rule reads it").

``consuming_rules = A ∪ B``. ``failure_modes`` = (item-099 mode anchors) ∪
(modes of ``consuming_rules`` under C, item 148: through a ``"signal"`` path
only) ∪ (modes of ``consuming_rules`` declared per rule, item 136 — may
include an analytic attribution outside the C term, item 137; item 148:
through a ``"signal"`` path only). ``mode_evidence`` is the ordered
subsequence of ``("per_mode_metric", "rule_mode_map", "rule_declaration",
"rule_mode_less", "rule_bookkeeping", "rule_not_read",
"rule_condition_signal")`` whose sources fired (the last, item 150, marks a
path a mode-less rule reads as a case *condition*'s evidence),
or exactly ``("rule_unmapped",)`` when no source fired but a consuming rule
said nothing, or ``()`` when neither applies. ``status`` = an authored
:data:`segfacet.feature_docs.STATUS_OVERRIDES` entry if present, else
``"keep"`` when A ∪ B ∪ D is non-empty, else **``"unwired"``**.

Two tiers, one ``origin``
--------------------------
Every catalogued path is realised by :func:`iter_driver_records` — the
"record"-tier drivers (built from :mod:`segfacet.synth` +
:func:`segfacet.pipeline.extract_feature_record`) and two "augmented" drivers
(``image_features`` / ``reference_delta``, built through the existing
converters over hand-constructed placeholder dataclass instances — no
PyRadiomics, no reference artifact, no scan). Both tiers flow through the
*same* :func:`iter_leaf_paths` walk and therefore the same ``origin ==
"record"`` classification (see the item's Decisions log for why a second
``origin`` value is not introduced: nothing downstream needs to distinguish
them and doing so would break the driver-union coverage equality, AC6).

Determinism contract
---------------------
:func:`build_catalogue` never mutates any input; two calls return equal
catalogues. :func:`catalogue_to_dict` / :func:`render_markdown` are pure
functions of the catalogue and are byte-reproducible within one session.
Heavy imports (NumPy/SciPy/NiBabel, via ``segfacet.pipeline``/
``segfacet.synth``) are deferred into function bodies, per ``cli.py``'s house
style, so ``import segfacet.catalogue`` alone stays cheap.

Scope fence
-----------
This module does **not** change any extractor, rule, threshold, schema,
report, or CLI behaviour. It touches no file under ``src/segfacet/
features/**``, ``heuristics/**``, ``eval/**``, ``synth/**``, ``reference/**``,
and none of ``pipeline.py``, ``feature_report.py``, ``cli.py``,
``report_schema_v0.json`` (AC25). It is not the drift test (item 104 — this
module only exposes the two shared primitives, :func:`iter_leaf_paths` and
:func:`iter_driver_records`, that test needs) and not the golden-file decision
table (item 105).

    and the corpus-derived ``rule_id -> failure mode(s)`` map (item 136).

    Returns a sorted tuple of human-readable messages, empty when the two
    sources agree. Reports, for the shipped registry:

    - a registered rule with no declaration at all (naming its ``rule_id``);
    - a corpus-designated ``(rule_id, mode)`` pair the rule's declaration does
      not carry in ``modes`` (naming both);
    - a corpus-designated ``rule_id`` that **no rule registers** (naming it) --
      item 147: this direction used to iterate the registered rules and was
      therefore blind to exactly the case it was meant to catch, a corpus
      case designating a rule that does not exist;
    - a declared mode outside :data:`segfacet.failure_modes.SPECIFICATION`'s
      key set -- the authored failure-mode specification (item 144), which
      since item 146 is the in-code failure-mode catalogue -- (naming both).
      Before item 146 this check sourced its known-mode set from
      :data:`segfacet.feature_docs.MODE_ANCHOR_PATHS`'s keys instead; the two
      agreed exactly while both were 1-8, and the specification is the one
      that grows when a mode enters through the lifecycle (item 147 completes
      the collapse of the remaining partial sources onto it);
    - (item 156, Seam 1) a declared **known** mode with no mirroring
      ``IntendedRule`` edge (naming both rule and mode) -- the declaration ->
      specification direction. Unconditional: reported whether or not a
      corpus case exists for the mode (spec Assumption A2). This is the
      direction :func:`segfacet.failure_modes.specification_conflicts`
      does not check (it only checks specification -> declaration), and the
      corpus -> declaration direction below does not check either (a corpus
      case's silence about a mode says nothing about whether the
      specification mirrors a declaration that names it).

    Item 147 retired the reserved ``"corpus"`` evidence tag and the
    declaration -> corpus direction it gated. That direction was an
    exact-element membership test over an unvalidated tuple, and the claim
    it stood for -- "a committed corpus case demonstrates this mode
    end-to-end" -- is data now: the per-edge ``evidence_rung`` on each
    ``IntendedRule`` in :data:`segfacet.failure_modes.SPECIFICATION`, whose
    own conformance check is
    :func:`segfacet.failure_modes.specification_conflicts`. A declaration's
    ``evidence`` is free-form provenance; nothing here reads an element of
    it for meaning, and no tag is an escape hatch from the corpus ->
    declaration direction, which is unconditional.

    Pure: never mutates the registry, never raises for a missing declaration
    (A3 -- absence is reported, not rejected).
