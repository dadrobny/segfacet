"""segfacet.reference.ingest — VerSe GT ingestion: cohort loader & feature-
extraction driver (Stage 6, item 044).

Turns a directory of ground-truth (GT) label maps into the per-case,
per-level ``FeatureRecord``s that the item-043 aggregation core
(``segfacet.reference.aggregate_reference``) consumes.

Scope
-----
This module is **ingestion only**:

* It does **not** compute means / percentiles / distributions (that is
  ``segfacet.reference.aggregate.aggregate_reference``, item 043) — it produces
  the *records* that function consumes.
* It does **not** write any reference artifact to disk, version it, or stamp
  build-time provenance (``source`` / ``config_hash`` / ``build_date``) —
  that is item 045's builder/loader.
* It does **not** change the feature engine — it calls
  ``segfacet.pipeline.extract_feature_record`` unchanged and reads geometry /
  spline-offset values out of its return value.
* It is deterministic and read-only: no wall-clock reads, no mutation of the
  caller's ``config``/``convention``, no writes to the cohort directory.

Discovery convention
---------------------
A "subject" is any file in the cohort directory whose name ends with
``seg_suffix`` (default ``DEFAULT_SEG_SUFFIX = "_seg.nii.gz"``). The
``subject_id`` is the filename stem with that suffix stripped. This mirrors
the Stage 5 corpus convention (``segfacet.synth.corpus.write_corpus``), so a
synthetic cohort written that way is a conforming directory out of the box.
An optional sibling scan (``<subject_id><DEFAULT_SCAN_SUFFIX>``) is discovered
per subject; it is read only when the caller opts in via ``with_intensity=
True`` (item 063), in which case per-label first-order intensity statistics
(item 059's ``compute_label_intensity``) are folded into that level's
``features``. With the default ``with_intensity=False``, the scan is
discovered but not read, exactly as before item 063.

Vocabulary
----------
``INGESTED_FEATURES`` is the pinned per-level *geometric* feature
vocabulary: the four ``LabelGeometry`` scalars plus ``spline_offset_mm``
(present only for subjects with >= 2 recognised levels, since Stage 3 is only
computed then). ``INGESTED_INTENSITY_FEATURES`` is the separate,
``intensity_``-prefixed per-label *intensity* vocabulary (item 063), folded
in only when ``with_intensity=True`` and a grid-aligned sibling scan is
present.

Size proxy
----------
``SIZE_PROXY_NAME = "mean_vertebra_volume_mm3"`` — the mean
``physical_volume_mm3`` across a subject's recognised, present levels.
Stamped identically on every record for that subject when
``with_size_proxy=True`` (the default); ``None`` when disabled.

Labels
------
Integer labels are normalised to canonical anatomical names via
``segfacet.labels.LabelConvention``. Background (value 0) is never a subject
level. Any present integer with no mapping in the convention is skipped —
never turned into a fabricated level — and recorded in
``SubjectIngest.skipped_labels``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seg_path:
        Path to the label-map NIfTI file.
    config:
        A :class:`~segfacet.config.HeuristicConfig`, threaded into
        ``extract_feature_record`` unchanged.
    convention:
        The :class:`~segfacet.labels.LabelConvention` used to normalise integer
        labels to canonical names. Defaults to
        :meth:`~segfacet.labels.LabelConvention.default`.
    scan_path:
        Optional path to a matching scan. Read only when ``with_intensity``
        is ``True``; otherwise accepted for interface symmetry with
        ``ingest_cohort`` but unused.
    subject_id:
        Explicit subject id; defaults to the filename stem with
        ``DEFAULT_SEG_SUFFIX`` stripped.
    with_size_proxy:
        When ``True`` (default), stamp each record with the subject's mean
        ``physical_volume_mm3`` across its recognised levels
        (``SIZE_PROXY_NAME``); when ``False``, every record's ``size_proxy``
        is ``None``.
    with_intensity:
        When ``True`` (default ``False``, preserving existing callers) and
        ``scan_path`` is not ``None``, load the scan and fold each
        recognised level's per-label first-order intensity statistics
        (item 059's ``compute_label_intensity``) into that level's
        ``features`` under ``intensity_*`` keys. A sentinel (all-``None``)
        ``LabelIntensity`` contributes no keys. When ``True`` but
        ``scan_path`` is ``None``, degrades silently to geometry-only. A
        grid-misaligned scan raises ``ValueError`` (propagated from the
        extractor).
    with_morphology:
        When ``True`` (default ``False``, preserving existing callers), fold
        each recognised level's geometric-morphology values --
        ``largest_component_fraction`` / ``component_count`` from that
        level's ``components`` block, and (when the subject has >= 2
        recognised levels, so Stage 3 ran) ``eigenvalue_ratio`` from its
        Stage 3 orientation entry -- into that level's ``features`` under
        their own (unprefixed) keys. Read from the ``components`` /
        orientation blocks, never from ``entry["geometry"]``. A single-label
        subject (no Stage 3) omits ``eigenvalue_ratio`` entirely -- ``None``
        is never inserted into a ``features`` mapping.
