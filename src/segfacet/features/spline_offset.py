"""Per-vertebra perpendicular offset from the fitted spline (item 018).

For each vertebra centroid in the ordered sequence, compute its closest-approach
distance to the parametric spline produced by :func:`segfacet.features.spline.fit_centroid_spline`.

The closest point on the spline is found by
:func:`segfacet.features.spline.find_closest_point` (item 130) -- the one
shared coarse-scan-then-refine search this module used to write out for
itself: a coarse scan over uniformly-spaced ``u`` values locates the
approximate minimum, then ``scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar`` refines it,
bracketed around the coarse minimum, for sub-mm accuracy.

The result is a :class:`VertebralSplineOffset` per centroid capturing the
Euclidean distance in mm and in voxel units (anisotropic-aware), the raw
signed-component displacement vector (dx_mm, dy_mm, dz_mm), and the spline
parameter value of the closest point.

Public API
----------
``VertebralSplineOffset``
    Frozen dataclass with per-centroid offset data.
``compute_spline_offsets(centroids, fit, spacing_mm=None) -> List[VertebralSplineOffset]``
    Compute one offset record per centroid, **in-sample**: the level under
    test shaped the curve it is measured against.
``compute_leave_one_out_spline_offsets(centroids, spacing_mm=None, *, backend=None) -> List[VertebralSplineOffset]``
    Compute one offset record per centroid, **held out** (item 120): the
    level under test does not shape the curve it is judged against.

Deliberate CPU fallback (item 072)
-----------------------------------
``compute_spline_offsets`` and ``compute_leave_one_out_spline_offsets`` both
accept a ``backend`` keyword for signature uniformity with the other Stage-2/3
feature functions, but their numeric work always runs on CPU: the coarse ``u``
scan, ``scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar`` refinement, and the leave-one-out
refits operate on tiny centroid arrays with no reliable CuPy equivalent, so
this is a documented, known partial-GPU-coverage limitation -- even under an
explicit GPU backend, the optimisation runs on SciPy/CPU with host arrays and
returns host results.

Held-out evaluation (item 120)
--------------------------------
``compute_spline_offsets`` is *in-sample*: the fit it is evaluated against was
shaped by every centroid it measures, including the one under test, so a
displaced vertebra pulls the smoothing spline (item 119) toward itself and its
own offset reads far below the applied displacement -- the circularity item
118 diagnosed. ``compute_leave_one_out_spline_offsets`` corrects this by
measuring each level against a curve it did not shape:

1. Fit once through all present centroids at equal weight (the "reference
   fit"), and identify the single most-deviant level under that fit -- the
   **dominant outlier**, chosen as the largest in-sample ``offset_mm``, ties
   broken by **ascending label**.
2. For each level in turn, refit through **the same chord-length
   parameterisation** (``u``) as the reference fit, but with that level's own
   weight and the dominant outlier's weight both driven to a negligible
   constant. Withholding by **down-weighting instead of dropping** keeps
   every level in the curve's parameter domain -- terminal levels are still
   measured against curve interior, not against a truncated endpoint -- while
   a negligible weight keeps the withheld level from pulling the fit toward
   itself. Withholding the case's dominant outlier too prevents one broken
   vertebra from bending its neighbours' held-out curves (outlier
   cross-talk).
3. Below **five** levels the held-out path falls back to the in-sample
   measurement (item 129, D5). The floor is five, not four, for a reason
   specific to this fit: at exactly four points the spline is a **cubic**
   (``k=3``) with exactly four coefficients, so it **interpolates** all four
   points **regardless of the weights** -- down-weighting a level to
   ``_WITHHELD_WEIGHT`` still leaves it, and every other point, exactly on
   the curve. The "held-out" curve at four points is therefore numerically
   the in-sample curve (the two agree to ~1e-13 mm on the corpus's one
   four-level case), and a floor of four silently claimed a held-out
   measurement it never made.

**Documented limitation: the four-level blind spot.** At exactly four
levels, an interior level displaced by a full **15 mm** still reads a
held-out ``offset_mm`` below **0.001 mm** -- both the held-out and in-sample
paths read essentially zero, so a four-level field of view cannot raise a
``spline_offset`` offset finding under any threshold (item 189 moved this
detector out of ``mislabel``). Measured 2026-08-31 (item
129); asserted, not only documented, by
``tests/test_129_coincident_centroids_and_held_out_floor.py``'s
four-level-blind-spot tests. Closing this gap needs a change to the fit's
**degree** at small ``n`` (clamping it below ``n - 1`` so a cubic cannot
interpolate four points) -- a change to the curve formulation the
2026-08-27 "Spinal curve model -- the deformity envelope" **human gate**
approved, and therefore not this module's (or any agent's) call to make.

**Documented limitation.** A displaced *terminal* level on a short spine is
not reliably separable: withholding a terminal level and the dominant outlier
leaves only three points to constrain a cubic at five levels (the committed
corpus's level count), so the held-out offset under-reports the true
displacement there. Real fields of view carry far more than five levels, and
this is measurably resolved by level count alone -- not worked around here.

**Documented limitation: only the single dominant outlier is withheld.**
Step 1 identifies and withholds one outlier per refit. With **two or more**
genuinely displaced levels, every un-withheld displaced level still pulls
every *other* level's held-out curve toward itself, which can both under-report
a real displacement and over-report a clean level as displaced. Measured on
the adversarial two-opposite-displacements case (two levels displaced in
opposite directions): a genuinely **clean** level reads **31.96 mm** while one
of the **displaced** levels reads only **19.31 mm** -- the clean level can be
named an offender ahead of an actual one. This is accepted as a known, shipped
limitation (not fixed by this item); the natural follow-up is withholding
every level above some outlier cutoff, not just the single dominant one, and
is left to future work.

Terminal-vertebra exclusion (item 123, 2026-08-29 human decision)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Every :class:`VertebralSplineOffset` carries ``is_terminal``: ``True`` for
the first and last entry of the ordered centroid sequence it was measured
in (and for **every** entry when the sequence has one or two points, so
there is no interior at all), ``False`` otherwise. It is sequence-relative,
not label-relative -- reversing the input order still marks the same two
anatomical ends, matched by which end they occupy, not by list index.

This exists because the held-out estimator's refit must **extrapolate**
past the end of its own parameter domain at a sequence terminus: withholding
a terminal level's own point still fits the curve through every interior
point, but the terminal level's closest-approach search runs past the last
interior control point rather than between two of them, which can read an
implausibly large offset for a vertebra that is not actually displaced.
Measured on the real VerSe19 cohort while calibrating this module's
``spline_offset`` threshold (item 123; the detector moved to that rule at
item 189): the caudal-terminal level (`L5` in most
of the cohort) reached a `p99` of `21.209` mm against an *interior* maximum
of `1.00` mm at the same level -- a purely positional artefact, not
deformity. `heuristics/spline_offset.py`, `reference/ingest.py` and
`reference/delta.py` all read this flag and exclude a terminal entry from
their respective offset judgements (never ``mislabel``'s ordering check, which
does not use per-vertebra offsets at all). This is a stop-gap accepted
knowingly, not a model of the true uncertainty: a genuinely displaced
terminal vertebra is not detected by this rule at all until a smarter
treatment (a separate terminal-aware calibration, an extrapolation-aware
estimator, or a curvature model that does not need both neighbours) replaces
it.

RAS axis contract for the direction components (item 120)
-------------------------------------------------------------
``dx_mm``, ``dy_mm`` and ``dz_mm`` are anatomically readable -- array axis 0
is left-right, axis 1 is anterior-posterior, axis 2 is cranio-caudal -- **only
because** two facts hold elsewhere in this codebase: ``segfacet.io.
load_volume`` reorients every volume to axis codes ``("R", "A", "S")``
(``io.py``'s ``_TARGET_AXCODES``) before any feature is computed, and
:func:`segfacet.features.centroids.compute_centroid` derives ``centroid_mm``
as ``centroid_voxel * spacing`` with no affine of its own. If either fact
changed, the direction components would still be well-defined numbers but
would no longer mean "left-right" / "anterior-posterior" / "cranio-caudal".

    fit:
        Optional externally-supplied in-sample :class:`SplineFit` to use as
        the reference fit (item 130), sparing a caller that already fit the
        same curve (``pipeline.extract_feature_record``, for curvature /
        tangent orientations / monotonic consistency) a second, redundant
        fit. When supplied, this function makes **no** ``fit_centroid_spline``
        call of its own for the reference fit -- the per-level held-out
        refits are unaffected and still happen here. The caller is
        responsible for supplying the in-sample fit through *these exact*
        centroids, fit at this module's own defaults (chord-length ``u``,
        uniform weights, default degree/smoothing) -- ``fit`` is validated
        only on centroid count (below), not on geometry: re-deriving it to
        verify would reinstate the second fit this parameter exists to
        remove. ``None`` (the default) reproduces today's behaviour: fit
        internally.
    backend:
        Optional :class:`~segfacet.backend.Backend` handle, forwarded to the
        fit/evaluate calls this function makes. The refits themselves always
        run on host NumPy/SciPy regardless -- see the module docstring's
