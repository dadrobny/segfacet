"""Rule abstraction and registry for the heuristic rule engine (item 026).

Provides:

- :class:`Rule` — abstract base class that every concrete rule family
  (items 027–033) must subclass and implement.
- :func:`register_rule` — function / decorator to register a ``Rule`` subclass
  in the module-level registry.
- :func:`get_rule` — look up a registered rule instance by ``rule_id``.
- :func:`iter_rules` — iterate over all registered rules in deterministic
  (ascending ``rule_id``) order.

The registry (``_RULES``) is a plain module-level dict exposed for test
isolation: tests snapshot / restore it to prevent cross-test leakage without
needing a dependency-injection framework.

Design decisions:
- Rules are **stateless** and **zero-argument**: ``register_rule`` instantiates
  each rule class once at registration time; thresholds are read from ``config``
  in ``evaluate``, not stored on the instance.
- Duplicate ``rule_id`` registration is rejected immediately (``ValueError``)
  to prevent silent shadowing.
- ``iter_rules()`` sorts by ``rule_id`` so the runner is always deterministic
  regardless of import / registration order.

    - **Targeted**: ``modes`` is a non-empty, strictly ascending tuple of
      ``int`` mode numbers (``>= 1``, no duplicates), with non-empty
      ``evidence`` — a tuple of non-empty strings carrying **free-form
      provenance**: which manifest and which case corroborate this
      declaration, or on what analytic grounds it is made. Item 147 retired
      the reserved ``"corpus"`` tag it used to carry: an exact-element
      membership test over an unvalidated tuple is not where an evidence
      claim belongs, and the mode ↔ rule evidence claim is data now — the
      per-edge ``evidence_rung`` on each ``IntendedRule`` in
      ``segfacet.failure_modes.SPECIFICATION``. Nothing in
      ``src/segfacet/`` reads an element of ``evidence`` for meaning::

          RuleModeDeclaration(
              modes=(6,),
              evidence=("corpus-manifest", "tests/corpus/manifest.json's crop_at_border ..."),
          )

    - **Mode-less**: the rule deliberately targets no §6 mode, with the
      reason recorded in ``mode_less_reason``::

          RuleModeDeclaration(mode_less_reason="structural sanity check, not a failure-mode detector")

    - **Pending**: the disposition is deferred to a named downstream item, in
      ``pending_reason``::

          RuleModeDeclaration(pending_reason="disposition deferred to item 137: ...")

    All four state fields default to empty; constructing a declaration that
    realises none of the three states (or more than one at once) raises
    ``ValueError``. Frozen: an existing instance cannot be mutated in place.

    ``consumed_paths`` (item 148) is the fifth, **additive** field: a tuple of
    :class:`ConsumedPath`, ascending and unique by ``path``, classifying every
    catalogued leaf path ``segfacet.catalogue.build_catalogue`` attributes to
    this rule. It is what lets the catalogue attribute a rule's §6 modes to
    the paths that can actually evidence them: only a ``"signal"`` pair
    contributes. It defaults to ``()`` so every pre-item-148 construction
    still constructs; a *registered* rule with a non-empty ``modes`` and an
    empty ``consumed_paths`` is reported by
    ``segfacet.catalogue.path_classification_conflicts()`` and contributes no
    mode anywhere — never a silent fall-back to the item-136 rule-granular
    behaviour.

    ``consumed_paths`` is **read-only metadata that no rule may consult
    inside** ``evaluate``: the whole declaration is a statement *about* the
    rule, never an input to it (asserted by AST over every rule module).
