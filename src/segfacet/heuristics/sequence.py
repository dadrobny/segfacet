"""Label-sequence continuity rule (item 030).

Implements a **sequence-continuity rule** targeting §6 failure mode 7 — a
non-continuous label sequence: a set of present vertebrae whose anatomical
ordering does not progress monotonically along the spine (reversals and
non-anatomical jumps, e.g. ``L1 -> T12 -> L2 -> L5``). It consumes the
pre-computed ``relationships`` sub-block (item 014, exposed via
``relationships_to_dict``, item 016) and does not recompute continuity
itself.

Design decisions (recorded per item 030 spec):
- The rule fires on ``relationships.out_of_order_labels`` being non-empty —
  the field that carries the concrete offenders to name/attribute — rather
  than on ``is_continuous`` directly. A malformed record with
  ``is_continuous == False`` but an empty ``out_of_order_labels`` therefore
  emits no finding (no concrete offender to name).
- Findings are **label-attributed** (non-empty ``labels``), in contrast to
  item 029's case-level missing-level findings: out-of-order vertebrae are
  present in the segmentation and carry real integer labels.
- One finding per case, naming all offenders in ``out_of_order_labels``
  order; the offending names are additionally resolved to integer labels via
  ``per_label`` (matching ``level_name``), omitting an unmappable name from
  ``labels`` while still naming it in the ``reason``.
- Unrecognised severity string raises ValueError before any per-record
  processing.
- The caller's record is never mutated.
