"""Overlap rule (item 032).

Implements an **overlap rule** targeting failure mode 15 (overlapping
segments) in ``failure_modes.SPECIFICATION``: voxels assigned to more than one vertebra label, or labels whose
masks intersect. It consumes the pre-computed overlap-detection results (item
015, exposed at the per-case feature record's top-level ``overlaps`` key,
assembled by ``build_features_block`` / ``overlap_to_dict``, item 016). It does
not re-derive overlaps and never touches a mask stack or label map.

Design decisions (recorded per item 032 spec):
- The rule reads **only** ``record["overlaps"]`` — never ``per_label``,
  ``relationships``, ``geometry``, or any mm/spacing/extent/volume field — so
  it is inherently spacing-agnostic.
- Any non-list ``overlaps`` (absent, ``None``, or a non-list placeholder such
  as ``{}``) is treated as "no overlaps" and yields no finding.
- One finding per overlapping pair, label-attributed with
  ``frozenset({label_a, label_b})`` (both offenders are present, real
  labels — unlike item 029's case-level missing-level findings).
- A config-driven minimum-overlap threshold (``min_overlap_voxels``, default
  ``1``) gates each finding: a pair fires iff ``overlap_voxels >=
  min_overlap_voxels``.
- Findings are emitted in ascending ``(label_a, label_b)`` order, re-sorted
  defensively regardless of input order, for determinism.
- Unrecognised severity string raises ValueError before any per-record
  processing.
- The caller's record is never mutated.
