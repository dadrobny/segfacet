"""Feature-extraction + QC orchestration pipeline (item 035).

Turns the already-merged Stage 2/3 extractors (items 011-020), the
``build_features_block`` assembler (item 016/022), the Stage 4 rule engine
(items 026-033), and the verdict aggregator (item 034) into a single,
production entry point that ``segfacet run`` (``cli.py``) drives:

``extract_feature_record(seg_img, config) -> dict``
    Compute the Stage 2 (and, when there are >= 2 labelled vertebrae, Stage 3)
    feature block for a segmentation image -- exactly the dict shape
    ``build_features_block`` already returns, unchanged, so it is the very
    same record the Stage 4 rules were written against.

``run_qc(seg_img, config, *, base_reasons=(), base_per_label=None) ->
tuple[CaseResult, dict]``
    Compose ``extract_feature_record`` with ``run_rules`` (item 026) and
    ``build_case_result`` (item 034) into one call: extract features, run the
    rules over them, fold the findings (plus any Stage 1 base reasons) into a
    verdict, and return both the :class:`~segfacet.aggregate.CaseResult` and the
    features block (so the CLI can embed both in the JSON report).

Design decisions (item 035)
----------------------------
1. **No new record schema.** ``extract_feature_record`` returns exactly what
   ``feature_report.build_features_block`` returns; the rules already consume
   that shape (items 027-033), so nothing new is introduced here.
2. **Stage 3 guarded on >= 2 centroids.** ``fit_centroid_spline`` (item 017)
   raises for < 2 points, so Stage 3 is only attempted when at least two
   labels are present; 0/1-label maps still produce a valid Stage-2-only
   block (no ``stage3`` key), matching ``mislabel``'s tolerant handling of an
   absent ``stage3`` sub-block.
3. **Ascending integer-label order is the "ordered centroid sequence".** The
   per-label ordering already used by ``build_features_block`` (ascending
   integer label) is reused as the single consistent order fed to
   ``compute_spine_relationships``, the spline fit, and every Stage 3
   extractor -- deterministic and requires no extra bookkeeping.
4. **Heavy imports (NumPy, SciPy, the ``segfacet.features``/``segfacet.heuristics``
   submodules) are deferred inside the functions**, consistent with the CLI's
   existing deferred-import style, so ``import segfacet.pipeline`` alone stays
   cheap.
5. **Coincident centroids degrade the Stage 3 block, not the whole record
   (item 129).** ``fit_centroid_spline`` raises ``ValueError`` when two
   centroids share an exact mm-coordinate (item 119, AC16). Rather than let
   that propagate out of ``extract_feature_record`` and lose every Stage 1/2
   feature, the >= 2-label branch pre-checks with
   ``features.spline.find_coincident_centroid_pair`` before attempting the
   fit: on a coincidence, ``stage3_kwargs`` stays empty (so no ``stage3`` key
   is emitted and ``features_version`` stays ``"0.1"``) and the cause is
   recorded as a ``stage3_unavailable`` mapping instead. Pre-checking rather
   than catching the broad ``ValueError`` means only this named cause
   degrades gracefully; any other fit failure still propagates.
5. **Read-only, deterministic, non-mutating.** Neither function mutates
   ``seg_img``, ``config``, ``base_reasons``, or ``base_per_label``; two calls
   on the same inputs return equal results (``aggregate_verdict`` /
   ``build_case_result`` already copy their inputs defensively).

    reference:
        Optional :class:`~segfacet.reference.schema.ReferenceDistribution`. When

    enable_pyradiomics:
        Forwarded to item 060's ``compute_radiomics_features``; when

        PyRadiomics happens to be installed.

        ``(case_result, features_block, image_features_block, reference_delta,
        intensity_reference_delta)``. ``features_block`` carries no
        ``image_features``/``reference``/``reference_delta``/
        ``intensity_reference_delta`` keys -- those live only on the
        transient rule-evaluation record. ``image_features_block`` is
        always populated (``available == True``) when this function
        succeeds. ``reference_delta``/``intensity_reference_delta`` are
        ``None`` unless *reference* is given. Deterministic and
        non-mutating: repeated calls on the same inputs return equal
        results, and none of ``seg_img``, ``scan_img``, ``config``, nor
        ``reference`` is modified.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``scan_img`` and ``seg_img`` have mismatched shapes or
        incompatible affines (beyond tolerance) -- item 059's
        ``_check_alignment`` guard.
