"""Label convention — integer labels <-> anatomical vertebrae (item 004).

This module is the **anatomy layer** over the loader's raw label inventory
(item 003). The loader exposes only integer label values and voxel counts
(``Case.label_inventory``, ``{label_value: voxel_count}``); this module maps
those integers to anatomical vertebra names (C1-C7, T1-T13, L1-L6, S, ...) and
back, and summarises a raw inventory into a human-meaningful form that separates
recognised vertebrae from unknown labels.

The convention is **tool-agnostic** (vision sections 4 and 5.1): the default is
the TotalSegmentator / VerSe vertebra numbering, but a caller can override it
with their own ``{value: name}`` mapping without code changes.

Scope (item 004): the name <-> value <-> ordinal convention plus an inventory
summariser. It makes **no** pass/fail judgement (verdicts are Stage 1/4), reads
**no** files (the on-disk heuristic-config schema is item 005), and does **not**
edit the CLI (item 006). It raises :class:`segfacet.io.FacetInputError` on a
malformed override so callers catch one input-error type for both load and
label-convention problems.

Public API
----------
``DEFAULT_LABEL_MAP`` : ``dict[int, str]``
    The default TotalSegmentator / VerSe value -> name table.
``CANONICAL_ORDER`` : ``tuple[str, ...]``
    Vertebra names in head-to-tail anatomical order.
``UNKNOWN`` : ``str``
    Sentinel name returned for an unmapped integer label.
``LabelConvention``
    Bidirectional, immutable label<->name convention (default or custom).
``InventorySummary``
    Result of :func:`summarise_inventory` — recognised vs unknown labels.
``summarise_inventory(inventory, convention=...) -> InventorySummary``
    Turn a raw ``{label: count}`` inventory into a named, ordered summary.

Item 186 adds a **section model** on top of ``CANONICAL_ORDER``: the expected
head-to-tail level sequence admits a per-section vertebra count (cervical is
always 7; thoracic is 11, 12 or 13; lumbar is 4, 5 or 6), because a real scan's
thoracolumbar transitional anatomy varies. ``SectionCounts``/
``DEFAULT_SECTION_COUNTS``/``SECTION_COUNT_RANGES``/``SACRUM`` name the model,
``expected_level_sequence`` builds the sequence for a given count triple, and
``resolve_section_counts`` reads a non-default count from the present labels
(accepted only with corroborating field-of-view evidence) or takes one supplied
by the caller outright. ``CANONICAL_ORDER`` itself is unchanged (still the
ranking every sort and the ``is_continuous`` check use) -- this is an
additional, narrower sequence that ``relationships.compute_spine_relationships``
walks for ``missing_levels``.

    ``False``, so the bare ``int`` check the read-side lookups use would wrongly
    reject those; we therefore accept any :class:`numbers.Integral` (covers
    ``int`` and numpy integer types) and any other numeric only when it is
    *exactly* integral (e.g. ``5.0`` but not ``1.9``), normalising the result to
    a Python ``int``.

    ``bool`` is an ``int`` subclass but is not a meaningful label value, so it is
    rejected — consistent with ``from_mapping``/``name_of``/``is_known``. A
    genuinely non-integral value (``1.9``), a non-numeric value (``"C1"``,
    ``"5"``, ``None``, ``"lots"``), or anything whose conversion would itself
    raise yields ``None`` rather than a coerced/leaked result.

    """Summarise a raw ``{label: count}`` inventory using a label convention.

    Partitions the present labels into **recognised** (mapped to an anatomical
    name) and **unknown** (no mapping), attaches names and voxel counts, and
    orders recognised entries head-to-tail by :data:`CANONICAL_ORDER`. Unknown
    labels are surfaced in :attr:`InventorySummary.unknown` — never dropped and
    never raising — so out-of-range, negative, or unmapped integers are handled
    gracefully.

    Reading the inventory is **strict/non-coercing** (Decision 6), symmetric
    with :meth:`LabelConvention.from_mapping`/:meth:`name_of`. The previous bare
    ``int(raw_value)`` / ``int(raw_count)`` is deliberately NOT used: it would
    silently truncate a non-integral key (``1.9 -> C1``) or count (``5.7 -> 5``),
    parse a string (``"5" -> C5``), collapse distinct keys into one value, or
    leak a raw ``ValueError`` / ``TypeError`` on a non-numeric key/count —
    corrupting the inventory or breaking the "never raising" contract. Instead a
    key or count is accepted only when it is an *integral* numeric (an ``int``, a
    numpy integer type via :class:`numbers.Integral`, or a ``float``/other real
    that is exactly integral such as ``5.0``); ``bool`` is excluded. A genuinely
    non-integral or non-numeric **key** is surfaced as an **unknown** label
    (never recognised), and an entry with a non-integral/non-numeric **count** is
    likewise routed to ``unknown`` rather than fabricating or truncating a count
    — both safe, non-raising outcomes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    inventory:
        ``{label_value: voxel_count}`` over present labels, e.g. the loader's
        :attr:`segfacet.io.Case.label_inventory` (whose keys/counts are already pure
        Python ``int``). A direct caller may also pass a numpy-keyed inventory.
        An empty mapping yields empty recognised/unknown lists.
    convention:
        The :class:`LabelConvention` to name labels with. Defaults to the shipped
        TotalSegmentator / VerSe convention.
