"""Affine-derived anatomical axis resolution, shared by every ``synth/``
operator that targets a named face or must avoid the stacking axis (item
116).

Item 108 made :mod:`segfacet.features.geometry` read the array-axis ->
anatomical-face mapping from a volume's own affine (via
``nibabel.aff2axcodes``) rather than assuming a fixed axis order. This module
is the ``synth/``-side mirror of that mapping: it lets an operator ask "which
array axis, and which end, is the 'superior' face on *this* volume's own
affine?" (:func:`resolve_face`), or "which array axis carries S/I on this
volume?" (:func:`si_axis`), instead of hardcoding an axis index. Every
operator that names a face or must stay off the stacking axis
(``CropAtBorderPerturbation``, ``FragmentPerturbation``,
``DisplacePerturbation``) resolves through this one module rather than
repeating the ``aff2axcodes`` logic locally.

Deliberately independent of :mod:`segfacet.features.geometry` (not imported
from it): that module is owned by item 108 and not modified here, and the
``synth/`` package's established convention (see e.g.
``coverage_border_overlap.py``'s module docstring) is to reimplement small
shared idioms locally rather than reach across package boundaries, so the two
packages can evolve independently. Both derive the same six-face mapping from
``nibabel.aff2axcodes`` by construction.
