"""Authored feature documentation & structural mappings (item 103; Stage 19).

Pure, stdlib-only data joined by :mod:`segfacet.catalogue`'s generator into the
committed feature & rule catalogue. This module imports nothing from
``segfacet`` and nothing outside the standard library, so it stays importable
with no NumPy/SciPy/NiBabel present (AC2) -- an AST scan of its own import
statements is part of the item's test suite.

Contents
--------
``FeatureDoc``
    Frozen dataclass: the authored prose for one normalised leaf path
    (``measures`` / ``computation`` / ``units`` / ``scale_sensitivity``).
``FEATURE_DOCS``
    ``{normalised_leaf_path: FeatureDoc}`` -- one entry per path the committed
    driver-record set realises (``segfacet.catalogue.iter_driver_records`` +
    ``iter_leaf_paths``). Kept in lock-step by
    ``segfacet.catalogue.build_catalogue(strict=True)``: an undocumented
    realised path or a stale key both raise (AC16/AC17), so this dict can
    never silently drift from the record shape it documents.
``BLOCK_OWNERS``
    Ordered ``(path_prefix, group_title, stage_label, module)`` rows; the
    generator matches each leaf path against the *longest* matching prefix
    (irrespective of authored order -- the generator does its own descending-
    length sort) to assign a group/stage/module, reproducing the pre-103
    hand-typed ``FEATURE_CATALOG`` grouping.
``GROUP_INTROS``
    ``{group_title: intro_prose}`` -- the per-group summary sentence(s) the
    pre-103 hand-typed ``FEATURE_CATALOG`` carried on each ``FeatureGroupSpec``
    (e.g. "For every present integer label, computed directly from the voxel
    mask..."). Looked up by ``group_title`` (the second element of the
    matched ``BLOCK_OWNERS`` row) when a ``CatalogueGroup`` is assembled;
    ``""`` for a title with no authored intro (never raises).
``PATH_ALIASES``
    ``{vocabulary_name: leaf_path}`` for mechanism D's declared-vocabulary
    matching, only where the vocabulary name is not itself the leaf path's
    last segment (``spline_offset_mm`` is tracked under the record field name
    ``offset_mm``, nested under ``stage3.per_label_offsets[]``).
``MODE_ANCHOR_PATHS``
    ``{mode_id: (leaf_path, ...)}``, keyed by ``failure_modes.SPECIFICATION``
    mode ids -- the record leaf path(s) item 099's per-mode metrics read (or,
    for a candidate-vs-GT metric with no record path of their own, the record
    path its *rule* counterpart reads instead; see the comment above the
    constant and this module's per-mode notes below). Every path here anchors that mode
    onto the matching catalogue entry with ``mode_evidence`` containing
    ``"per_mode_metric"`` (AC14).
``STATUS_OVERRIDES``
    ``{leaf_path: (status, rationale)}`` -- ships **empty**. ``retune``/
    ``retire`` are human judgments; Stage 19's checkpoint (items 105/106)
    populates this map after reading the generated catalogue. Every wired
    path starts at ``"keep"`` and every unread path at ``"unwired"`` -- both
    derived, both honest -- until that review lands.

Mode-anchor notes (mode ids are ``failure_modes.SPECIFICATION``'s)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Mode 1** (segmentation accuracy) is anchored on
  ``per_label.{label}.components.fragmentation_index`` -- the record path
  its fragment metric reads (item 154 re-anchor; see the comment above
  ``MODE_ANCHOR_PATHS``).
- **Mode 8** (semantic mislabelling; ``mislabelled_volume_fraction``,
  candidate-vs-GT) is anchored on
  ``stage3.monotonic_consistency.is_monotonic`` -- the same
  ``monotonic_consistency`` sub-block ``MislabelRule``'s Detector B (which
  serves mode 9, out-of-order label sequence, a sub-mode of mode 8) reads
  its ``non_monotonic_pairs`` signal from. ``is_monotonic`` itself
  (rather than ``non_monotonic_pairs[]``) is deliberately the anchor so
  ``non_monotonic_pairs[]`` -- the field Detector B actually reads and the
  *only* leaf path exclusively consumed by ``mislabel`` -- stays a plain,
  code-derived (mechanism A) attribution rather than being absorbed into the
  anchor set; item 103's AC13 test asserts such an exclusively-consumed,
  non-anchor witness exists per mapped rule.
- **Mode 6** (vertebra not segmented; ``missing_level_count``,
  candidate-vs-GT) is anchored on
  ``relationships.present_levels[]`` -- the present-level span
  ``heuristics.coverage.CoverageRule`` resolves its missing-level checks
  against. ``relationships.missing_levels[]`` itself -- the field the rule
  actually reads and coverage's only exclusively-consumed leaf path -- is
  deliberately left as a plain attribution for the same reason as mode 8
  above.
- **Mode 9** (out-of-order label sequence; ``out_of_order_label_count``) is
  anchored on
  ``relationships.is_continuous`` -- the companion continuity flag in the
  same ``relationships`` sub-block ``heuristics.sequence.SequenceRule``
  reads its ``out_of_order_labels`` signal from, for the same reason:
  ``relationships.out_of_order_labels[]`` is ``sequence``'s only
  exclusively-consumed leaf path and is left as a plain attribution.

``MetricSpec`` (``segfacet.eval.per_mode``) carries no record-path field, so
this transcription cannot be read off it mechanically; a future item that adds
one should replace this hand-transcription by reading it instead (see the
item 103 spec's Assumptions).

# the metrics themselves (segfacet.eval.per_mode.PER_MODE_METRIC_SPECS) off
# their former pre-sign-off id map onto their own metric names, each now
# carrying this same specification mode id (or None) as a nullable
# ``failure_mode`` field; the mapping from metric to mode below is unchanged
# by that re-key: unanchored_foreground_fraction and

# ``per_label.{label}.components.fragmentation_index``, which
# ``heuristics.fragmentation`` consumes as ``signal``, one of mode 1's
# intended rules. ``unanchored_foreground_fraction`` is computed
# candidate-vs-GT and reads no record path, so it has no anchor here. The
# spline-offset path (``stage3.per_label_offsets[].offset_mm``) is dropped:
# its only consumer, ``mislabel``, was classified at the item-150 sign-off
# as serving no failure mode (mislabel itself declares that path
# ``bookkeeping``, not ``signal``), so mode 1's anchor and mode 1's
# mechanism disagreed. The corresponding candidate-feature role in
# ``failure_modes._MODE_1`` moved from ``"stage18-metric-anchor"`` to
